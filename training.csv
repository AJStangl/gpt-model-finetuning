It took the site 4 years and a pandemic to take off. Building platforms up takes time, so we have to continue moving more content onto the site and encouraging subs to join.

Tbh, I‚Äôve never heard anyone really interested in using LoyalFans. OF and Fansly are the blog-style platforms I hear the most.

Lately I‚Äôve been seeing creators who are giving advice about how to do well on only fans and I thought I would give my personal advice. I‚Äôve been a creator for over two years and for most of that time I have been with in the top 1%. My percentage has hovered between 0.7% to 0.5% during this time depending on the month.

The majority of my income comes from subscribers/subscriptions, and about half of my income is made up of PPV and tips combined. I gain most of my subscribers from Reddit and TikTok, my tiktok subscribers are diverted to Instagram where they then find my link.

If you want to gain subscribers from Reddit you need to remember a few key things. Firstly, you should invest in a good quality ring light because lighting is very important in photos and videos. Shooting in natural light is always better than shooting in a dark room or a room without natural light. If you have a big window in your house somewhere or some thing on your property that faces south, do most of your shooting in there where the best lighting is. Secondly make sure that your phone has a good camera. I get all of my content from my phone‚Äòs camera, and I have an iPhone 11 Pro. It‚Äôs also worth it to invest in a little Bluetooth clicker to take your photos with.

When it comes to content for Reddit, I find the gifs do better than still photos. Take 15 to 20 second videos on your phone and then convert them with redgifs. Once you‚Äôve converted the video, take the link from the GIFs page and submit it to reddit as a link post. Try not to reuse the same gif/photo more than three times in a day, and once you‚Äôve used it 3ish times, wait at least a couple weeks before posting it again somewhere else. Many of the biggest subreddits have spam rules and if you re-post the same gif a bunch of times on your own profile and especially multiple times in the same sub Reddit they will ban you. Make sure you are also somewhat creative with your titles. Don‚Äôt reuse the same title for every single post you make in a day, or it will look spammy even if the content is different.

In terms of titles, stay away from anything whiny like ‚Äúno one thinks I‚Äôm pretty‚Äú or ‚Äúwhy do I never get subscribers‚Äú. Your page is a business and businesses need to move with confidence. It does not build confidence in your brand if you were complaining about how undesirable people find you. make sure you are posting in subReddit‚Äòs that fit your body type - this means looking at who is posting in those subs and seeing if you match their body type. For example, I‚Äôve seen girls here complain that they were banned from a petite centred sub Reddit because despite being 5 feet tall, they are curvy. On Reddit, things don‚Äôt always mean what we think they mean, and mods can be ruthless. Once you have found sub Reddit‚Äôs that you fit into, look at what posts are getting the top spots and top upvotes every day and emulate that in your content.

Certain selling subreddits have been successful for me, but make sure that you‚Äôre posting mainly in non-advertising subs. This makes your wall seem less spammy if people are scrolling through it. Make sure you have a little bio at the top of your reddit profile, and link your OnlyFans at the top and in a pinned post.

Lately I‚Äôve been seeing creators who are giving advice about how to do well on only fans and I thought I would give my personal advice. I‚Äôve been a creator for over two years and for most of that time I have been with in the top 1%. My percentage has hovered between 0.7% to 0.5% during this time depending on the month.

The majority of my income comes from subscribers/subscriptions, and about half of my income is made up of PPV and tips combined. I gain most of my subscribers from Reddit and TikTok, my tiktok subscribers are diverted to Instagram where they then find my link.

If you want to gain subscribers from Reddit you need to remember a few key things. Firstly, you should invest in a good quality ring light because lighting is very important in photos and videos. Shooting in natural light is always better than shooting in a dark room or a room without natural light. If you have a big window in your house somewhere or some thing on your property that faces south, do most of your shooting in there where the best lighting is. Secondly make sure that your phone has a good camera. I get all of my content from my phone‚Äòs camera, and I have an iPhone 11 Pro. It‚Äôs also worth it to invest in a little Bluetooth clicker to take your photos with.

When it comes to content for Reddit, I find the gifs do better than still photos. Take 15 to 20 second videos on your phone and then convert them with redgifs. Once you‚Äôve converted the video, take the link from the GIFs page and submit it to reddit as a link post. Try not to reuse the same gif/photo more than three times in a day, and once you‚Äôve used it 3ish times, wait at least a couple weeks before posting it again somewhere else. Many of the biggest subreddits have spam rules and if you re-post the same gif a bunch of times on your own profile and especially multiple times in the same sub Reddit they will ban you. Make sure you are also somewhat creative with your titles. Don‚Äôt reuse the same title for every single post you make in a day, or it will look spammy even if the content is different.

In terms of titles, stay away from anything whiny like ‚Äúno one thinks I‚Äôm pretty‚Äú or ‚Äúwhy do I never get subscribers‚Äú. Your page is a business and businesses need to move with confidence. It does not build confidence in your brand if you were complaining about how undesirable people find you. make sure you are posting in subReddit‚Äòs that fit your body type - this means looking at who is posting in those subs and seeing if you match their body type.

In terms of titles, stay away from anything whiny like ‚Äúno one thinks I‚Äôm pretty‚Äú or ‚Äúwhy do I never get subscribers‚Äú. Your page is a business and businesses need to move with confidence. It does not build confidence in your brand if you were complaining about how undesirable people find you. make sure you are posting in subReddit‚Äòs that fit your body type - this means looking at who is posting in those subs and seeing if you match their body type. For example, I‚Äôve seen girls here complain that they were banned from a petite centred sub Reddit because despite being 5 feet tall, they are curvy. On Reddit, things don‚Äôt always mean what we think they mean, and mods can be ruthless. Once you have found sub Reddit‚Äôs that you fit into, look at what posts are getting the top spots and top upvotes every day and emulate that in your content.

Certain selling subreddits have been successful for me, but make sure that you‚Äôre posting mainly in non-advertising subs. This makes your wall seem less spammy if people are scrolling through it. Make sure you have a little bio at the top of your reddit profile, and link your OnlyFans at the top and in a pinned post.

Lately I‚Äôve been seeing creators who are giving advice about how to do well on only fans and I thought I would give my personal advice. I‚Äôve been a creator for over two years and for most of that time I have been with in the top 1%. My percentage has hovered between 0.7% to 0.5% during this time depending on the month.

The majority of my income comes from subscribers/subscriptions, and about half of my income is made up of PPV and tips combined. I gain most of my subscribers from Reddit and TikTok, my tiktok subscribers are diverted to Instagram where they then find my link.

If you want to gain subscribers from Reddit you need to remember a few key things. Firstly, you should invest in a good quality ring light because lighting is very important in photos and videos. Shooting in natural light is always better than shooting in a dark room or a room without natural light. If you have a big window in your house somewhere or some thing on your property that faces south, do most of your shooting in there where the best lighting is. Secondly make sure that your phone has a good camera. I get all of my content from my phone‚Äòs camera, and I have an iPhone 11 Pro. It‚Äôs also worth it to invest in a little Bluetooth clicker to take your photos with.

When it comes to content for Reddit, I find the gifs do better than still photos. Take 15 to 20 second videos on your phone and then convert them with redgifs. Once you‚Äôve converted the video, take the link from the GIFs page and submit it to reddit as a link post. Try not to reuse the same gif/photo more than three times in a day, and once you‚Äôve used it 3ish times, wait at least a couple weeks before posting it again somewhere else. Many of the biggest subreddits have spam rules and if you re-post the same gif a bunch of times on your own profile and especially multiple times in the same sub Reddit they will ban you.

Once you have found sub Reddit‚Äôs that you fit into, look at what posts are getting the top spots and top upvotes every day and emulate that in your content.

Certain selling subreddits have been successful for me, but make sure that you‚Äôre posting mainly in non-advertising subs. This makes your wall seem less spammy if people are scrolling through it.

The majority of my income comes from subscribers/subscriptions, and about half of my income is made up of PPV and tips combined. I gain most of my subscribers from Reddit and TikTok, my tiktok subscribers are diverted to Instagram where they then find my link.

If you want to gain subscribers from Reddit you need to remember a few key things. Firstly, you should invest in a good quality ring light because lighting is very important in photos and videos. Shooting in natural light is always better than shooting in a dark room or a room without natural light. If you have a big window in your house somewhere or some thing on your property that faces south, do most of your shooting in there where the best lighting is. Secondly make sure that your phone has a good camera. I get all of my content from my phone‚Äòs camera, and I have an iPhone 11 Pro. It‚Äôs also worth it to invest in a little Bluetooth clicker to take your photos with.

When it comes to content for Reddit, I find the gifs do better than still photos. Take 15 to 20 second videos on your phone and then convert them with redgifs. Once you‚Äôve converted the video, take the link from the GIFs page and submit it to reddit as a link post. Try not to reuse the same gif/photo more than three times in a day, and once you‚Äôve used it 3ish times, wait at least a couple weeks before posting it again somewhere else. Many of the biggest subreddits have spam rules and if you re-post the same gif a bunch of times on your own profile and especially multiple times in the same sub Reddit they will ban you. Make sure you are also somewhat creative with your titles. Don‚Äôt reuse the same title for every single post you make in a day, or it will look spammy even if the content is different.

In terms of titles, stay away from anything whiny like ‚Äúno one thinks I‚Äôm pretty‚Äú or ‚Äúwhy do I never get subscribers‚Äú. Your page is a business and businesses need to move with confidence. It does not build confidence in your brand if you were complaining about how undesirable people find you. make sure you are posting in subReddit‚Äòs that fit your body type - this means looking at who is posting in those subs and seeing if you match their body type.

Lately I‚Äôve been seeing creators who are giving advice about how to do well on only fans and I thought I would give my personal advice. I‚Äôve been a creator for over two years and for most of that time I have been with in the top 1%. My percentage has hovered between 0.7% to 0.5% during this time depending on the month.

The majority of my income comes from subscribers/subscriptions, and about half of my income is made up of PPV and tips combined. I gain most of my subscribers from Reddit and TikTok, my tiktok subscribers are diverted to Instagram where they then find my link.

If you want to gain subscribers from Reddit you need to remember a few key things. Firstly, you should invest in a good quality ring light because lighting is very important in photos and videos. Shooting in natural light is always better than shooting in a dark room or a room without natural light. If you have a big window in your house somewhere or some thing on your property that faces south, do most of your shooting in there where the best lighting is. Secondly make sure that your phone has a good camera. I get all of my content from my phone‚Äòs camera, and I have an iPhone 11 Pro. It‚Äôs also worth it to invest in a little Bluetooth clicker to take your photos with.

When it comes to content for Reddit, I find the gifs do better than still photos. Take 15 to 20 second videos on your phone and then convert them with redgifs. Once you‚Äôve converted the video, take the link from the GIFs page and submit it to reddit as a link post. Try not to reuse the same gif/photo more than three times in a day, and once you‚Äôve used it 3ish times, wait at least a couple weeks before posting it again somewhere else. Many of the biggest subreddits have spam rules and if you re-post the same gif a bunch of times on your own profile and especially multiple times in the same sub Reddit they will ban you. Make sure you are also somewhat creative with your titles. Don‚Äôt reuse the same title for every single post you make in a day, or it will look spammy even if the content is different.

In terms of titles, stay away from anything whiny like ‚Äúno one thinks I‚Äôm pretty‚Äú or ‚Äúwhy do I never get subscribers‚Äú. Your page is a business and businesses need to move with confidence. It does not build confidence in your brand if you were complaining about how undesirable people find you. make sure you are posting in subReddit‚Äòs that fit your body type - this means looking at who is posting in those subs and seeing if you match their body type. For example, I‚Äôve seen girls here complain that they were banned from a petite centred sub Reddit because despite being 5 feet tall, they are curvy. On Reddit, things don‚Äôt always mean what we think they mean, and mods can be ruthless. Once you have found sub Reddit‚Äôs that you fit into, look at what posts are getting the top spots and top upvotes every day and emulate that in your content.

Certain selling subreddits have been successful for me, but make sure that you‚Äôre posting mainly in non-advertising subs. This makes your wall seem less spammy if people are scrolling through it. Make sure you have a little bio at the top of your reddit profile, and link your OnlyFans at the top and in a pinned post.

Lately I‚Äôve been seeing creators who are giving advice about how to do well on only fans and I thought I would give my personal advice. I‚Äôve been a creator for over two years and for most of that time I have been with in the top 1%. My percentage has hovered between 0.7% to 0.5% during this time depending on the month.

The majority of my income comes from subscribers/subscriptions, and about half of my income is made up of PPV and tips combined. I gain most of my subscribers from Reddit and TikTok, my tiktok subscribers are diverted to Instagram where they then find my link.

If you want to gain subscribers from Reddit you need to remember a few key things. Firstly, you should invest in a good quality ring light because lighting is very important in photos and videos. Shooting in natural light is always better than shooting in a dark room or a room without natural light. If you have a big window in your house somewhere or some thing on your property that faces south, do most of your shooting in there where the best lighting is. Secondly make sure that your phone has a good camera. I get all of my content from my phone‚Äòs camera, and I have an iPhone 11 Pro. It‚Äôs also worth it to invest in a little Bluetooth clicker to take your photos with.

When it comes to content for Reddit, I find the gifs do better than still photos. Take 15 to 20 second videos on your phone and then convert them with redgifs. Once you‚Äôve converted the video, take the link from the GIFs page and submit it to reddit as a link post. Try not to reuse the same gif/photo more than three times in a day, and once you‚Äôve used it 3ish times, wait at least a couple weeks before posting it again somewhere else. Many of the biggest subreddits have spam rules and if you re-post the same gif a bunch of times on your own profile and especially multiple times in the same sub Reddit they will ban you. Make sure you are also somewhat creative with your titles. Don‚Äôt reuse the same title for every single post you make in a day, or it will look spammy even if the content is different.

In terms of titles, stay away from anything whiny like ‚Äúno one thinks I‚Äôm pretty‚Äú or ‚Äúwhy do I never get subscribers‚Äú. Your page is a business and businesses need to move with confidence. It does not build confidence in your brand if you were complaining about how undesirable people find you. make sure you are posting in subReddit‚Äòs that fit your body type - this means looking at who is posting in those subs and seeing if you match their body type. For example, I‚Äôve seen girls here complain that they were banned from a petite centred sub Reddit because despite being 5 feet tall, they are curvy. On Reddit, things don‚Äôt always mean what we think they mean, and mods can be ruthless. Once you have found sub Reddit‚Äôs that you fit into, look at what posts are getting the top spots and top upvotes every day and emulate that in your content.

Certain selling subreddits have been successful for me, but make sure that you‚Äôre posting mainly in non-advertising subs. This makes your wall seem less spammy if people are scrolling through it. Make sure you have a little bio at the top of your reddit profile, and link your OnlyFans at the top and in a pinned post.

Any other questions? Let me know and I‚Äôll do my best to address them!!<|eost|><|sor u/innapropriate_v|>Do you post nude/topless on Reddit and if you do, what is your opinion about tik tok ppl googling you and find Reddit?

Posting this because I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts here about dealing with burnout, demotivation, anxiety, self image etc. and I have so many experiences with these things that perhaps sharing would be useful to a few ppl. This is a long post so sorry in advance üíñü¶≠

As a past top creator who‚Äôs now taking a break and plateaued (I‚Äôm in the process of taking a long hiatus and potentially making the decision to quit, not sure yet) this is my advice:

üåü Therapy is a game changer. Look up Pineapple Support (pineapplesupport.org)üçç it‚Äôs a fantastic resource for affordable care for sex workers. I found my therapist through there.

üåü Taking breaks ‚Äî how often do you take a true break where you‚Äôre fully logged out? I used to think I took breaks all the time but my toxic overworking ass found sneaky ways to work while ‚Äúresting‚Äù. Our capitalist society looks down on resting, which is heinous because our minds + bodies need it to function. Burnout is the worst and the remedy is taking time off. Enjoy your irl real life

üåü If you‚Äôre uninspired, a break could also recharge and replenish your creative juices. Sometimes the best ideas come to me while I‚Äôm doing something mundane. Also, on a content creating level, turning a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù moment into a horny experience is something subscribers enjoy. The true ride or die will be there even after a break. It‚Äôs normal for ppl to go after a month and everyone eventually gets over you; it‚Äôs nothing personal it‚Äôs literally just male attention span

üåü Stop comparing urself to others. Easier said than done cuz we live in a culture that perpetuates comparison, but moments of true introspection are really important. No one but you lives ur life. Success and failure are cyclical, plateauing is normal, and the notion that we need to outdo ourselves is toxic as hell. Goals are great, to a fault. Every day we‚Äôre inundated and brainwashed with unrealistic standards of beauty, success, aspirational shit etc. Why can‚Äôt we be happy with where we are/who we are?

üåü imo percentages on OF are a ridiculous concept. We obsess over a made up number that changes constantly. As long as ur making a good income to afford ur living / pay some bills / save a little, who cares what the per cent is? Everyone‚Äôs definition of success is different ‚Äî some ppl need more or less depending on where they live, debts, responsibilities, families, etc.

üåü This summer has been slow as fuck for many of us. The state of the world/US Economy sucks balls. Don‚Äôt take it personally if it‚Äôs slow. Don‚Äôt take anything from subs personally! I struggle with that one a lot, but sometimes ppl unsub just bc they can‚Äôt afford you, not cause you‚Äôre doing something wrong. We‚Äôre entertainment, not a life necessity. Not everyone can afford the luxury of interactive parasocial porn when there‚Äôs gas, bills, kids, groceries, and other shit rising in prices from this inflation. Yeah there‚Äôs def a few girls who thrive in even hard times‚Ä¶ but during dips like this, future proof ur OF income by supplementing it with something else; another platform or line or work altogether. Unless you‚Äôre like top-top it‚Äôs risky to rely on OF to be ur full time

üåü Self image: it‚Äôs cheesy af but we are all beautiful and have a market for each one of us. It‚Äôs hard to compare to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù genetic lottery winning girls who also happen to be marketing geniuses, but we all have our niche. This is why we even have the potential to have subscribers‚Äî someone out there is attracted to something about YOU. Keep radiating ur essence and you will have loyal subs. Everything online already feels like an advertisement so give ur subs a sense of ur reality, as much as you are comfortable with

üåü Don‚Äôt take shit from dudes who push your boundaries! Your page is your page and you work at your own pace and comfort level. Yes, be professional and give them excellent service, but also remember to take care of your health ‚Äî real life comes first

üåü Have a reason to get into this profession besides money. I know OF is often peddled as a get rich quick scheme but as we all know that is very far from true. Obviously we are here for income. But having expectations/having ur eye strictly on the $ may be disappointing. Expectations in general are a gateway to disappointment in so many fields of life. What are your secondary/tertiary reasons for starting and OF? I see it as a creative outlet, a work of art, and a place where my body confidence has been boosted. I used to have an ED for over a decade and could never even look at myself naked, much imagine this could be my job. It may sound counterintuitive cause we‚Äôre picked apart by our looks, but I love the compliments my nudes get. I had never gotten any irl before. I hated letting people see me naked or touch me that weren‚Äôt clients. Now I have a bf and I am happier with my body; if my OF career ended tomorrow I will be forever thankful for generating that kind of self love. I still feel depressed often but looking back, a few years progress is a big deal

üåü Again ‚Äî don‚Äôt expect super fast growth overnight!! It *can* happen, you can do all the tricks and the right marketing and be on ur phone 14rs a day 7 days a week, but be careful of burnout and be kind to yourself

üåü Be kind to ur fellow SWers. This is a competitive industry and making friends can be hard. This can also be a very private, isolating field. Having someone to talk to is essential, whether it be a therapist or a friend or a fellow OF creator. I‚Äôm open to talk and help as much as I can cause I hate seeing people going through this kind of shit and struggling with burnout and self esteem issues. We are some of the best, hottest, smartest, most creative and wonderful people! Like minded ladies say hi! I wish there was more potential for a online SW/OF union. Can we start one lol??

I hope this helps someone because I wish I had something like this when I first started: someone who didn‚Äôt gatekeep or sugarcoat, to tell me to shut the fuck up, enjoy creating my work (we are privileged to do this online safely in our homes), stop stressing about bullshit, and have fun in life. OF can be so exciting and amazing and creative so if it gets to be mechanical and job-like, that‚Äôs when I know to take breaks and recharge. We‚Äôre not machines. I know it can be hard to take breaks cause we‚Äôre so conditioned to work our asses off, but rearranging ur reward cycle away from the cyber realms can be healthy. OF is not allll of ur life.

I started a small personal project last year called Cyberhorny that unpacks the psychological elements of online sex work [you can read the PDF here](https://www.cyber-horny.com/post/navigating-a-sexual-dystopia-the-pdf) ! I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù with advice. Let‚Äôs be real there‚Äôs a lot of mental health issues we contend with in this line of work.

Anyway!! Sorry about the long rant, have a beautiful week! If this helps you, great! If not, I hope you find something that doesüíó Much love ü¶ã

Posting this because I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts here about dealing with burnout, demotivation, anxiety, self image etc. and I have so many experiences with these things that perhaps sharing would be useful to a few ppl. This is a long post so sorry in advance üíñü¶≠

As a past top creator who‚Äôs now taking a break and plateaued (I‚Äôm in the process of taking a long hiatus and potentially making the decision to quit, not sure yet) this is my advice:

üåü Therapy is a game changer. Look up Pineapple Support (pineapplesupport.org)üçç it‚Äôs a fantastic resource for affordable care for sex workers. I found my therapist through there.

üåü Taking breaks ‚Äî how often do you take a true break where you‚Äôre fully logged out? I used to think I took breaks all the time but my toxic overworking ass found sneaky ways to work while ‚Äúresting‚Äù. Our capitalist society looks down on resting, which is heinous because our minds + bodies need it to function. Burnout is the worst and the remedy is taking time off. Enjoy your irl real life

üåü If you‚Äôre uninspired, a break could also recharge and replenish your creative juices. Sometimes the best ideas come to me while I‚Äôm doing something mundane. Also, on a content creating level, turning a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù moment into a horny experience is something subscribers enjoy. The true ride or die will be there even after a break. It‚Äôs normal for ppl to go after a month and everyone eventually gets over you; it‚Äôs nothing personal it‚Äôs literally just male attention span

üåü Stop comparing urself to others. Easier said than done cuz we live in a culture that perpetuates comparison, but moments of true introspection are really important. No one but you lives ur life. Success and failure are cyclical, plateauing is normal, and the notion that we need to outdo ourselves is toxic as hell. Goals are great, to a fault. Every day we‚Äôre inundated and brainwashed with unrealistic standards of beauty, success, aspirational shit etc. Why can‚Äôt we be happy with where we are/who we are?

üåü imo percentages on OF are a ridiculous concept. We obsess over a made up number that changes constantly. As long as ur making a good income to afford ur living / pay some bills / save a little, who cares what the per cent is? Everyone‚Äôs definition of success is different ‚Äî some ppl need more or less depending on where they live, debts, responsibilities, families, etc.

üåü This summer has been slow as fuck for many of us. The state of the world/US Economy sucks balls. Don‚Äôt take it personally if it‚Äôs slow. Don‚Äôt take anything from subs personally! I struggle with that one a lot, but sometimes ppl unsub just bc they can‚Äôt afford you, not cause you‚Äôre doing something wrong. We‚Äôre entertainment, not a life necessity. Not everyone can afford the luxury of interactive parasocial porn when there‚Äôs gas, bills, kids, groceries, and other shit rising in prices from this inflation. Yeah there‚Äôs def a few girls who thrive in even hard times‚Ä¶ but during dips like this, future proof ur OF income by supplementing it with something else; another platform or line or work altogether. Unless you‚Äôre like top-top it‚Äôs risky to rely on OF to be ur full time

üåü Self image: it‚Äôs cheesy af but we are all beautiful and have a market for each one of us. It‚Äôs hard to compare to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù genetic lottery winning girls who also happen to be marketing geniuses, but we all have our niche. This is why we even have the potential to have subscribers‚Äî someone out there is attracted to something about YOU. Keep radiating ur essence and you will have loyal subs. Everything online already feels like an advertisement so give ur subs a sense of ur reality, as much as you are comfortable with

üåü Don‚Äôt take shit from dudes who push your boundaries! Your page is your page and you work at your own pace and comfort level. Yes, be professional and give them excellent service, but also remember to take care of your health ‚Äî real life comes first

üåü Have a reason to get into this profession besides money. I know OF is often peddled as a get rich quick scheme but as we all know that is very far from true. Obviously we are here for income. But having expectations/having ur eye strictly on the $ may be disappointing. Expectations in general are a gateway to disappointment in so many fields of life. What are your secondary/tertiary reasons for starting and OF? I see it as a creative outlet, a work of art, and a place where my body confidence has been boosted. I used to have an ED for over a decade and could never even look at myself naked, much imagine this could be my job. It may sound counterintuitive cause we‚Äôre picked apart by our looks, but I love the compliments my nudes get. I had never gotten any irl before. I hated letting people see me naked or touch me that weren‚Äôt clients. Now I have a bf and I am happier with my body; if my OF career ended tomorrow I will be forever thankful for generating that kind of self love. I still feel depressed often but looking back, a few years progress is a big deal

üåü Again ‚Äî don‚Äôt expect super fast growth overnight!! It *can* happen, you can do all the tricks and the right marketing and be on ur phone 14rs a day 7 days a week, but be careful of burnout and be kind to yourself

üåü Be kind to ur fellow SWers. This is a competitive industry and making friends can be hard. This can also be a very private, isolating field. Having someone to talk to is essential, whether it be a therapist or a friend or a fellow OF creator. I‚Äôm open to talk and help as much as I can cause I hate seeing people going through this kind of shit and struggling with burnout and self esteem issues. We are some of the best, hottest, smartest, most creative and wonderful people! Like minded ladies say hi! I wish there was more potential for a online SW/OF union. Can we start one lol??

I hope this helps someone because I wish I had something like this when I first started: someone who didn‚Äôt gatekeep or sugarcoat, to tell me to shut the fuck up, enjoy creating my work (we are privileged to do this online safely in our homes), stop stressing about bullshit, and have fun in life. OF can be so exciting and amazing and creative so if it gets to be mechanical and job-like, that‚Äôs when I know to take breaks and recharge. We‚Äôre not machines. I know it can be hard to take breaks cause we‚Äôre so conditioned to work our asses off, but rearranging ur reward cycle away from the cyber realms can be healthy. OF is not allll of ur life.

Posting this because I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts here about dealing with burnout, demotivation, anxiety, self image etc. and I have so many experiences with these things that perhaps sharing would be useful to a few ppl. This is a long post so sorry in advance üíñü¶≠

As a past top creator who‚Äôs now taking a break and plateaued (I‚Äôm in the process of taking a long hiatus and potentially making the decision to quit, not sure yet) this is my advice:

üåü Therapy is a game changer. Look up Pineapple Support (pineapplesupport.org)üçç it‚Äôs a fantastic resource for affordable care for sex workers. I found my therapist through there.

üåü Taking breaks ‚Äî how often do you take a true break where you‚Äôre fully logged out? I used to think I took breaks all the time but my toxic overworking ass found sneaky ways to work while ‚Äúresting‚Äù. Our capitalist society looks down on resting, which is heinous because our minds + bodies need it to function. Burnout is the worst and the remedy is taking time off. Enjoy your irl real life

üåü If you‚Äôre uninspired, a break could also recharge and replenish your creative juices. Sometimes the best ideas come to me while I‚Äôm doing something mundane. Also, on a content creating level, turning a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù moment into a horny experience is something subscribers enjoy. The true ride or die will be there even after a break. It‚Äôs normal for ppl to go after a month and everyone eventually gets over you; it‚Äôs nothing personal it‚Äôs literally just male attention span

üåü Stop comparing urself to others. Easier said than done cuz we live in a culture that perpetuates comparison, but moments of true introspection are really important. No one but you lives ur life. Success and failure are cyclical, plateauing is normal, and the notion that we need to outdo ourselves is toxic as hell. Goals are great, to a fault. Every day we‚Äôre inundated and brainwashed with unrealistic standards of beauty, success, aspirational shit etc. Why can‚Äôt we be happy with where we are/who we are?

üåü imo percentages on OF are a ridiculous concept. We obsess over a made up number that changes constantly. As long as ur making a good income to afford ur living / pay some bills / save a little, who cares what the per cent is? Everyone‚Äôs definition of success is different ‚Äî some ppl need more or less depending on where they live, debts, responsibilities, families, etc.

üåü This summer has been slow as fuck for many of us. The state of the world/US Economy sucks balls. Don‚Äôt take it personally if it‚Äôs slow. Don‚Äôt take anything from subs personally! I struggle with that one a lot, but sometimes ppl unsub just bc they can‚Äôt afford you, not cause you‚Äôre doing something wrong. We‚Äôre entertainment, not a life necessity. Not everyone can afford the luxury of interactive parasocial porn when there‚Äôs gas, bills, kids, groceries, and other shit rising in prices from this inflation. Yeah there‚Äôs def a few girls who thrive in even hard times‚Ä¶ but during dips like this, future proof ur OF income by supplementing it with something else; another platform or line or work altogether. Unless you‚Äôre like top-top it‚Äôs risky to rely on OF to be ur full time

üåü Self image: it‚Äôs cheesy af but we are all beautiful and have a market for each one of us. It‚Äôs hard to compare to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù genetic lottery winning girls who also happen to be marketing geniuses, but we all have our niche. This is why we even have the potential to have subscribers‚Äî someone out there is attracted to something about YOU. Keep radiating ur essence and you will have loyal subs. Everything online already feels like an advertisement so give ur subs a sense of ur reality, as much as you are comfortable with

üåü Don‚Äôt take shit from dudes who push your boundaries! Your page is your page and you work at your own pace and comfort level. Yes, be professional and give them excellent service, but also remember to take care of your health ‚Äî real life comes first

üåü Have a reason to get into this profession besides money. I know OF is often peddled as a get rich quick scheme but as we all know that is very far from true. Obviously we are here for income. But having expectations/having ur eye strictly on the $ may be disappointing. Expectations in general are a gateway to disappointment in so many fields of life. What are your secondary/tertiary reasons for starting and OF? I see it as a creative outlet, a work of art, and a place where my body confidence has been boosted. I used to have an ED for over a decade and could never even look at myself naked, much imagine this could be my job. It may sound counterintuitive cause we‚Äôre picked apart by our looks, but I love the compliments my nudes get. I had never gotten any irl before. I hated letting people see me naked or touch me that weren‚Äôt clients. Now I have a bf and I am happier with my body; if my OF career ended tomorrow I will be forever thankful for generating that kind of self love. I still feel depressed often but looking back, a few years progress is a big deal

üåü Again ‚Äî don‚Äôt expect super fast growth overnight!! It *can* happen, you can do all the tricks and the right marketing and be on ur phone 14rs a day 7 days a week, but be careful of burnout and be kind to yourself

üåü Be kind to ur fellow SWers. This is a competitive industry and making friends can be hard. This can also be a very private, isolating field. Having someone to talk to is essential, whether it be a therapist or a friend or a fellow OF creator. I‚Äôm open to talk and help as much as I can cause I hate seeing people going through this kind of shit and struggling with burnout and self esteem issues. We are some of the best, hottest, smartest, most creative and wonderful people! Like minded ladies say hi! I wish there was more potential for a online SW/OF union. Can we start one lol??

I hope this helps someone because I wish I had something like this when I first started: someone who didn‚Äôt gatekeep or sugarcoat, to tell me to shut the fuck up, enjoy creating my work (we are privileged to do this online safely in our homes), stop stressing about bullshit, and have fun in life. OF can be so exciting and amazing and creative so if it gets to be mechanical and job-like, that‚Äôs when I know to take breaks and recharge. We‚Äôre not machines. I know it can be hard to take breaks cause we‚Äôre so conditioned to work our asses off, but rearranging ur reward cycle away from the cyber realms can be healthy. OF is not allll of ur life.

I started a small personal project last year called Cyberhorny that unpacks the psychological elements of online sex work [you can read the PDF here](https://www.cyber-horny.com/post/navigating-a-sexual-dystopia-the-pdf) ! I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù with advice. Let‚Äôs be real there‚Äôs a lot of mental health issues we contend with in this line of work.

Anyway!! Sorry about the long rant, have a beautiful week! If this helps you, great! If not, I hope you find something that doesüíó Much love ü¶ã

Our capitalist society looks down on resting, which is heinous because our minds + bodies need it to function. Burnout is the worst and the remedy is taking time off. Enjoy your irl real life

üåü If you‚Äôre uninspired, a break could also recharge and replenish your creative juices. Sometimes the best ideas come to me while I‚Äôm doing something mundane. Also, on a content creating level, turning a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù moment into a horny experience is something subscribers enjoy. The true ride or die will be there even after a break. It‚Äôs normal for ppl to go after a month and everyone eventually gets over you; it‚Äôs nothing personal it‚Äôs literally just male attention span

üåü Stop comparing urself to others. Easier said than done cuz we live in a culture that perpetuates comparison, but moments of true introspection are really important. No one but you lives ur life. Success and failure are cyclical, plateauing is normal, and the notion that we need to outdo ourselves is toxic as hell. Goals are great, to a fault. Every day we‚Äôre inundated and brainwashed with unrealistic standards of beauty, success, aspirational shit etc. Why can‚Äôt we be happy with where we are/who we are?

üåü imo percentages on OF are a ridiculous concept. We obsess over a made up number that changes constantly. As long as ur making a good income to afford ur living / pay some bills / save a little, who cares what the per cent is? Everyone‚Äôs definition of success is different ‚Äî some ppl need more or less depending on where they live, debts, responsibilities, families, etc.

üåü This summer has been slow as fuck for many of us. The state of the world/US Economy sucks balls. Don‚Äôt take it personally if it‚Äôs slow. Don‚Äôt take anything from subs personally! I struggle with that one a lot, but sometimes ppl unsub just bc they can‚Äôt afford you, not cause you‚Äôre doing something wrong. We‚Äôre entertainment, not a life necessity. Not everyone can afford the luxury of interactive parasocial porn when there‚Äôs gas, bills, kids, groceries, and other shit rising in prices from this inflation. Yeah there‚Äôs def a few girls who thrive in even hard times‚Ä¶ but during dips like this, future proof ur OF income by supplementing it with something else; another platform or line or work altogether. Unless you‚Äôre like top-top it‚Äôs risky to rely on OF to be ur full time

üåü Self image: it‚Äôs cheesy af but we are all beautiful and have a market for each one of us. It‚Äôs hard to compare to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù genetic lottery winning girls who also happen to be marketing geniuses, but we all have our niche. This is why we even have the potential to have subscribers‚Äî someone out there is attracted to something about YOU. Keep radiating ur essence and you will have loyal subs. Everything online already feels like an advertisement so give ur subs a sense of ur reality, as much as you are comfortable with

üåü Don‚Äôt take shit from dudes who push your boundaries! Your page is your page and you work at your own pace and comfort level. Yes, be professional and give them excellent service, but also remember to take care of your health ‚Äî real life comes first

üåü Have a reason to get into this profession besides money. I know OF is often peddled as a get rich quick scheme but as we all know that is very far from true. Obviously we are here for income. But having expectations/having ur eye strictly on the $ may be disappointing. Expectations in general are a gateway to disappointment in so many fields of life. What are your secondary/tertiary reasons for starting and OF? I see it as a creative outlet, a work of art, and a place where my body confidence has been boosted. I used to have an ED for over a decade and could never even look at myself naked, much imagine this could be my job. It may sound counterintuitive cause we‚Äôre picked apart by our looks, but I love the compliments my nudes get. I had never gotten any irl before. I hated letting people see me naked or touch me that weren‚Äôt clients. Now I have a bf and I am happier with my body; if my OF career ended tomorrow I will be forever thankful for generating that kind of self love. I still feel depressed often but looking back, a few years progress is a big deal

üåü Again ‚Äî don‚Äôt expect super fast growth overnight!! It *can* happen, you can do all the tricks and the right marketing and be on ur phone 14rs a day 7 days a week, but be careful of burnout and be kind to yourself

üåü Be kind to ur fellow SWers. This is a competitive industry and making friends can be hard. This can also be a very private, isolating field. Having someone to talk to is essential, whether it be a therapist or a friend or a fellow OF creator. I‚Äôm open to talk and help as much as I can cause I hate seeing people going through this kind of shit and struggling with burnout and self esteem issues. We are some of the best, hottest, smartest, most creative and wonderful people! Like minded ladies say hi! I wish there was more potential for a online SW/OF union. Can we start one lol??

I hope this helps someone because I wish I had something like this when I first started: someone who didn‚Äôt gatekeep or sugarcoat, to tell me to shut the fuck up, enjoy creating my work (we are privileged to do this online safely in our homes), stop stressing about bullshit, and have fun in life. OF can be so exciting and amazing and creative so if it gets to be mechanical and job-like, that‚Äôs when I know to take breaks and recharge. We‚Äôre not machines. I know it can be hard to take breaks cause we‚Äôre so conditioned to work our asses off, but rearranging ur reward cycle away from the cyber realms can be healthy. OF is not allll of ur life.

As a past top creator who‚Äôs now taking a break and plateaued (I‚Äôm in the process of taking a long hiatus and potentially making the decision to quit, not sure yet) this is my advice:

üåü Therapy is a game changer. Look up Pineapple Support (pineapplesupport.org)üçç it‚Äôs a fantastic resource for affordable care for sex workers. I found my therapist through there.

üåü Taking breaks ‚Äî how often do you take a true break where you‚Äôre fully logged out? I used to think I took breaks all the time but my toxic overworking ass found sneaky ways to work while ‚Äúresting‚Äù. Our capitalist society looks down on resting, which is heinous because our minds + bodies need it to function. Burnout is the worst and the remedy is taking time off. Enjoy your irl real life

üåü If you‚Äôre uninspired, a break could also recharge and replenish your creative juices. Sometimes the best ideas come to me while I‚Äôm doing something mundane. Also, on a content creating level, turning a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù moment into a horny experience is something subscribers enjoy. The true ride or die will be there even after a break. It‚Äôs normal for ppl to go after a month and everyone eventually gets over you; it‚Äôs nothing personal it‚Äôs literally just male attention span

üåü Stop comparing urself to others. Easier said than done cuz we live in a culture that perpetuates comparison, but moments of true introspection are really important. No one but you lives ur life. Success and failure are cyclical, plateauing is normal, and the notion that we need to outdo ourselves is toxic as hell. Goals are great, to a fault. Every day we‚Äôre inundated and brainwashed with unrealistic standards of beauty, success, aspirational shit etc. Why can‚Äôt we be happy with where we are/who we are?

üåü imo percentages on OF are a ridiculous concept. We obsess over a made up number that changes constantly. As long as ur making a good income to afford ur living / pay some bills / save a little, who cares what the per cent is? Everyone‚Äôs definition of success is different ‚Äî some ppl need more or less depending on where they live, debts, responsibilities, families, etc.

üåü This summer has been slow as fuck for many of us. The state of the world/US Economy sucks balls. Don‚Äôt take it personally if it‚Äôs slow. Don‚Äôt take anything from subs personally! I struggle with that one a lot, but sometimes ppl unsub just bc they can‚Äôt afford you, not cause you‚Äôre doing something wrong. We‚Äôre entertainment, not a life necessity.

Unless you‚Äôre like top-top it‚Äôs risky to rely on OF to be ur full time

üåü Self image: it‚Äôs cheesy af but we are all beautiful and have a market for each one of us. It‚Äôs hard to compare to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù genetic lottery winning girls who also happen to be marketing geniuses, but we all have our niche. This is why we even have the potential to have subscribers‚Äî someone out there is attracted to something about YOU. Keep radiating ur essence and you will have loyal subs. Everything online already feels like an advertisement so give ur subs a sense of ur reality, as much as you are comfortable with

üåü Don‚Äôt take shit from dudes who push your boundaries! Your page is your page and you work at your own pace and comfort level. Yes, be professional and give them excellent service, but also remember to take care of your health ‚Äî real life comes first

üåü Have a reason to get into this profession besides money. I know OF is often peddled as a get rich quick scheme but as we all know that is very far from true. Obviously we are here for income.

Now I have a bf and I am happier with my body; if my OF career ended tomorrow I will be forever thankful for generating that kind of self love.

üåü Again ‚Äî don‚Äôt expect super fast growth overnight!! It *can* happen, you can do all the tricks and the right marketing and be on ur phone 14rs a day 7 days a week, but be careful of burnout and be kind to yourself

üåü Be kind to ur fellow SWers. This is a competitive industry and making friends can be hard. This can also be a very private, isolating field.

We are some of the best, hottest, smartest, most creative and wonderful people! Like minded ladies say hi! I wish there was more potential for a online SW/OF union. Can we start one lol??

I hope this helps someone because I wish I had something like this when I first started: someone who didn‚Äôt gatekeep or sugarcoat, to tell me to shut the fuck up, enjoy creating my work (we are privileged to do this online safely in our homes), stop stressing about bullshit, and have fun in life. OF can be so exciting and amazing and creative so if it gets to be mechanical and job-like, that‚Äôs when I know to take breaks and recharge. We‚Äôre not machines. I know it can be hard to take breaks cause we‚Äôre so conditioned to work our asses off, but rearranging ur reward cycle away from the cyber realms can be healthy. OF is not allll of ur life.

I‚Äôm so glad you think so; I‚Äôve wanted to make it into a book/bigger project but it‚Äôs so hard to take time away from OF.

Posting this because I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts here about dealing with burnout, demotivation, anxiety, self image etc. and I have so many experiences with these things that perhaps sharing would be useful to a few ppl. This is a long post so sorry in advance üíñü¶≠

As a past top creator who‚Äôs now taking a break and plateaued (I‚Äôm in the process of taking a long hiatus and potentially making the decision to quit, not sure yet) this is my advice:

üåü Therapy is a game changer. Look up Pineapple Support (pineapplesupport.org)üçç it‚Äôs a fantastic resource for affordable care for sex workers. I found my therapist through there.

üåü Taking breaks ‚Äî how often do you take a true break where you‚Äôre fully logged out? I used to think I took breaks all the time but my toxic overworking ass found sneaky ways to work while ‚Äúresting‚Äù. Our capitalist society looks down on resting, which is heinous because our minds + bodies need it to function. Burnout is the worst and the remedy is taking time off. Enjoy your irl real life

üåü If you‚Äôre uninspired, a break could also recharge and replenish your creative juices. Sometimes the best ideas come to me while I‚Äôm doing something mundane. Also, on a content creating level, turning a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù moment into a horny experience is something subscribers enjoy. The true ride or die will be there even after a break. It‚Äôs normal for ppl to go after a month and everyone eventually gets over you; it‚Äôs nothing personal it‚Äôs literally just male attention span

üåü Stop comparing urself to others. Easier said than done cuz we live in a culture that perpetuates comparison, but moments of true introspection are really important. No one but you lives ur life. Success and failure are cyclical, plateauing is normal, and the notion that we need to outdo ourselves is toxic as hell. Goals are great, to a fault. Every day we‚Äôre inundated and brainwashed with unrealistic standards of beauty, success, aspirational shit etc. Why can‚Äôt we be happy with where we are/who we are?

üåü imo percentages on OF are a ridiculous concept. We obsess over a made up number that changes constantly. As long as ur making a good income to afford ur living / pay some bills / save a little, who cares what the per cent is? Everyone‚Äôs definition of success is different ‚Äî some ppl need more or less depending on where they live, debts, responsibilities, families, etc.

üåü This summer has been slow as fuck for many of us. The state of the world/US Economy sucks balls. Don‚Äôt take it personally if it‚Äôs slow. Don‚Äôt take anything from subs personally! I struggle with that one a lot, but sometimes ppl unsub just bc they can‚Äôt afford you, not cause you‚Äôre doing something wrong. We‚Äôre entertainment, not a life necessity. Not everyone can afford the luxury of interactive parasocial porn when there‚Äôs gas, bills, kids, groceries, and other shit rising in prices from this inflation. Yeah there‚Äôs def a few girls who thrive in even hard times‚Ä¶ but during dips like this, future proof ur OF income by supplementing it with something else; another platform or line or work altogether. Unless you‚Äôre like top-top it‚Äôs risky to rely on OF to be ur full time

üåü Self image: it‚Äôs cheesy af but we are all beautiful and have a market for each one of us. It‚Äôs hard to compare to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù genetic lottery winning girls who also happen to be marketing geniuses, but we all have our niche. This is why we even have the potential to have subscribers‚Äî someone out there is attracted to something about YOU. Keep radiating ur essence and you will have loyal subs. Everything online already feels like an advertisement so give ur subs a sense of ur reality, as much as you are comfortable with

üåü Don‚Äôt take shit from dudes who push your boundaries! Your page is your page and you work at your own pace and comfort level. Yes, be professional and give them excellent service, but also remember to take care of your health ‚Äî real life comes first

üåü Have a reason to get into this profession besides money. I know OF is often peddled as a get rich quick scheme but as we all know that is very far from true. Obviously we are here for income. But having expectations/having ur eye strictly on the $ may be disappointing. Expectations in general are a gateway to disappointment in so many fields of life. What are your secondary/tertiary reasons for starting and OF? I see it as a creative outlet, a work of art, and a place where my body confidence has been boosted. I used to have an ED for over a decade and could never even look at myself naked, much imagine this could be my job. It may sound counterintuitive cause we‚Äôre picked apart by our looks, but I love the compliments my nudes get. I had never gotten any irl before. I hated letting people see me naked or touch me that weren‚Äôt clients. Now I have a bf and I am happier with my body; if my OF career ended tomorrow I will be forever thankful for generating that kind of self love. I still feel depressed often but looking back, a few years progress is a big deal

üåü Again ‚Äî don‚Äôt expect super fast growth overnight!! It *can* happen, you can do all the tricks and the right marketing and be on ur phone 14rs a day 7 days a week, but be careful of burnout and be kind to yourself

üåü Be kind to ur fellow SWers. This is a competitive industry and making friends can be hard. This can also be a very private, isolating field. Having someone to talk to is essential, whether it be a therapist or a friend or a fellow OF creator. I‚Äôm open to talk and help as much as I can cause I hate seeing people going through this kind of shit and struggling with burnout and self esteem issues. We are some of the best, hottest, smartest, most creative and wonderful people! Like minded ladies say hi! I wish there was more potential for a online SW/OF union. Can we start one lol??

I've seen a lot of posts and comments saying that they ""only"" have 300, 400, 500 subs and it drives me nuts.

How do you guys with big numbers like that get so many paying subs? I get having that many on a free page but I see so many people say they have hundreds of paying subscribers, that's wild to me!

A few questions:

1.What do you do to get that many?

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from?

3. Did you start from a zero social media following?

4.  Are you conventionally attractive?

5.How much do you show when you promote? (Meaning showing tits, pussy, ass or do you stay fully covered?)

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

10. If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post?

Anyone else here have small numbers (less than 50 subs) ?",ijzie0v,"I have 5.6K fans,  Top 0.8%.

1. I have big boobs,  I'm also BBW
2. Tiktok -  I was getting millions of views but since been shadowbanned but if you persevere with it, you'll get a constant flow of subs.  I don't use any other platform to promote, I have instagram and Twitter just for the links.
3. I started with 0 social media presence
4. I would say I'm conventionally attractive to a certain niche
5. I show 0 nudity when promoting
6. I don't reply to Dms -  in my opinion, it's a waste of time
7. I show face

I've seen a lot of posts and comments saying that they ""only"" have 300, 400, 500 subs and it drives me nuts.

How do you guys with big numbers like that get so many paying subs? I get having that many on a free page but I see so many people say they have hundreds of paying subscribers, that's wild to me!

A few questions:

1.What do you do to get that many?

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from?

3. Did you start from a zero social media following?

4.  Are you conventionally attractive?

5.How much do you show when you promote? (Meaning showing tits, pussy, ass or do you stay fully covered?)

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

10. If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post?

Anyone else here have small numbers (less than 50 subs) ?<|eost|><|sor u/Mspameliajj|>I have 5.6K fans,  Top 0.8%.

1. I have big boobs,  I'm also BBW
2. Tiktok -  I was getting millions of views but since been shadowbanned but if you persevere with it, you'll get a constant flow of subs.  I don't use any other platform to promote, I have instagram and Twitter just for the links.
3. I started with 0 social media presence
4. I would say I'm conventionally attractive to a certain niche
5. I show 0 nudity when promoting
6. I don't reply to Dms -  in my opinion, it's a waste of time

I think it‚Äôs really about finding what works for you. I feel like tiktok allows me to show my personality and creativity which my subs like. I don‚Äôt really promote anywhere else.

I've seen a lot of posts and comments saying that they ""only"" have 300, 400, 500 subs and it drives me nuts.

How do you guys with big numbers like that get so many paying subs? I get having that many on a free page but I see so many people say they have hundreds of paying subscribers, that's wild to me!

A few questions:

1.What do you do to get that many?

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from?

3. Did you start from a zero social media following?

4.  Are you conventionally attractive?

5.How much do you show when you promote? (Meaning showing tits, pussy, ass or do you stay fully covered?)

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

10. If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post?

basically, be in front of their eyeballs wherever you can :)
twitter, reddit, tube sites - if you do SFW content (I don't at all ;): insta, tiktok, and the likes.
if you're happy and have time to cam, do it.
also invest in traffic, buy promo on OF, twitter, etc. - but check first if it really fits. Get on telegram to do SFS with fellow models (free).
1) make polls where people come from. about a third of mine are from PH/XV/XH, the tube sites. Make good trailers/previews for these, also a full video here and there. watermark your content, people will type it in. Get an easy to type domain (with WHOIS ID protection!!) and redirect it to OnlyFans - in the future, tons of your content will be out there, and if you change your OF URL or switch to another platform, that traffic will be gone if you use your OF URL as watermark. An own domain can be redirected wherever you like, anytime. We get between 2k and 5k type ins daily on ours. On xhamster, if you post full videos and are a registered creator, you'll get a banner under your clips leading to your paysite.
2) 1/3 social media, 1/3 tube sites, 1/3 SFS and paid promo
3) yes. now check my reddit, on twitter I have about 500k followers on 2 accounts
4) see above
5) all :) except face
6) yes, a lot. I also talk to fellow models about SFS. always sad when I find people wo have messages blocked on reddit, you're missing a lot of opportunities! it's easy to ignore creeps in DMs, but a lot of ppl will buy your OF if they see on reddit you're real.
7) no
8) I tried, but focused more on the paid
9) no, I'm more the ""high subscription (19.99), no PPV"" type as I'd like that as well. But personal choice, both can be very successful. don't underestimate the amount of ppl who will forget about their subscription and still pay. PPV means convincing them to buy every single time.

7. I didn't for the first 10 months and started showing it after that. During those 10 months I was always around 50-100 subs and once I started showing it I got a lot more (not sure if it's directly related or not)
8. No my sub price is $9.99
9. Yep I do! I have shorter videos for $5.99 and longer (7-12 mins) for $9.99
10. I don't use reddit anymore<|eor|><|endoftext|>",EmmaLane_

Anyone else here have small numbers (less than 50 subs) ?",ijze03g,"1. I started on cam sites which gave me a decent start but I use Reddit, TikTok, IG and occasionally Twitter. I've personally never seen much conversion from Twitter when putting in the work despite having over 25k followers. TikTok I post on multiple accounts and push the limits as far as possible, I care more about views than I do followers. You'll get deleted, it's invevitable so push it as far as you can. Reddit and IG I treat as if it were my personal social media, I don't spam links, I post about my life, likes, dislikes, fun stuff.

2. I have a poll on my page and right now the majority is Reddit, followed closely be TikTok.

3. Yes I started completely from scratch.

4. I like to think I look alright ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but I'm a BBW girl so that can have it's setbacks lol

5. The only place I post explicit content is Reddit and even more so it's playful and funny GIFs. Mostly boobs or full frontal nudes with occasional pussy GIFs. I also delete a lot of explicit posts as I have a really big problem with someone stealing content on here.

6. Never it's the biggest waste of time and you could be entertaining minors without your knowledge. All of my DMs are turned off.

7. Yes

8. I recently started one but it's not up to the standard I'd like it yet so I go between promoting it and removing the link from my beacons lol

9. Yes but I also have quite a few full length videos on my feed as well.

10. Nowadays I only post max 15 posts a day and I try to spread this out. Before I used to be posting upwards of 30 but it's draining and spam like I find. I try to post little updates every few days as well, again I treat it like an actual social media.

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from? 95% Reddit, a few from ManyVids and Twitter.

Anyone else here have small numbers (less than 50 subs) ?",ik18jnt,"I'm mostly a clip creator, so my approach might be a little different from most people whose primary business is Onlyfans :)

* What do you do to get that many? - **1)** I post free videos on tube sites, and watermark them with my website (www.ClaraDee.com). It links out to all of my pay sites, including OF. Only a small percentage of people subscribe, but it adds up to a few hundred subs, and I don't have to bust my ass promoting all day every day. **2)** Recently, I've started incentivizing them to stay by sending my PPVs (2-4 a month) free to subs with rebill on. I started doing this 4 months ago and I've gone from 300 to 500 paying subs. The videos are full price on the free account, half price on the premium account, and free if you have rebill turned on. I also make short trailers and post them on my socials.
* Where do you think you got your majority of subs from? - Most of my subs come from tube sites (Pornhub, Xvideos, xHamster). I post about half of my videos there (full-length, uncensored), and the other half are paywall. That's basically the only promotion I do. I don't have Tiktok and I barely use socials.
* Did you start from a zero social media following? - No, by the time I started using OF, I already had a following.
* Are you conventionally attractive? - Yeah I check all the boxes, but I'm not naturally photogenic. I've put a ton of work and money into my appearance over the years: learned to do makeup/angles/photoshop, laser hair removal, keratin treatments, dying my hair... I deleted all my early content because I look so different. Fake eyelashes were a game changer.
* How much do you show when you promote? - Full nude, explicit
* Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs? - Absolutely not. 99% of of them have no intention of ever buying anything, and it becomes unmanageable when you have a bigger following. If someone wants to order a custom from me, they can pay my very reasonable [$1 discussion fee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clara_Dee/wiki/discussionfee) to talk to me about it.
* Do you show face? - Yes
* Do you have a free page? - Yes
* Do you sell PPV? - Yes, but it functions mostly as an incentive to get people to sub to my premium account, and turn on rebill.
* If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post? - I've never been a daily poster. My biggest success has been in r/JOI. I post there whenever I post a new JOI video on my tube sites.","<|soss r/onlyfansadvice|><|sot|>How do you get HUNDREDS of subs?<|eot|><|sost|>Edit to add: I think some people are trying to comment but it won't show if you are not verified

* What do you do to get that many? - **1)** I post free videos on tube sites, and watermark them with my website (www.ClaraDee.com). It links out to all of my pay sites, including OF. Only a small percentage of people subscribe, but it adds up to a few hundred subs, and I don't have to bust my ass promoting all day every day. **2)** Recently, I've started incentivizing them to stay by sending my PPVs (2-4 a month) free to subs with rebill on. I started doing this 4 months ago and I've gone from 300 to 500 paying subs. The videos are full price on the free account, half price on the premium account, and free if you have rebill turned on. I also make short trailers and post them on my socials.
* Where do you think you got your majority of subs from? - Most of my subs come from tube sites (Pornhub, Xvideos, xHamster). I post about half of my videos there (full-length, uncensored), and the other half are paywall. That's basically the only promotion I do. I don't have Tiktok and I barely use socials.
* Did you start from a zero social media following? - No, by the time I started using OF, I already had a following.
* Are you conventionally attractive? - Yeah I check all the boxes, but I'm not naturally photogenic. I've put a ton of work and money into my appearance over the years: learned to do makeup/angles/photoshop, laser hair removal, keratin treatments, dying my hair... I deleted all my early content because I look so different. Fake eyelashes were a game changer.
* How much do you show when you promote? - Full nude, explicit
* Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs? - Absolutely not. 99% of of them have no intention of ever buying anything, and it becomes unmanageable when you have a bigger following. If someone wants to order a custom from me, they can pay my very reasonable [$1 discussion fee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clara_Dee/wiki/discussionfee) to talk to me about it.
* Do you show face? - Yes
* Do you have a free page? - Yes
* Do you sell PPV? - Yes, but it functions mostly as an incentive to get people to sub to my premium account, and turn on rebill.
* If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post? - I've never been a daily poster. My biggest success has been in r/JOI. I post there whenever I post a new JOI video on my tube sites.<|eor|><|endoftext|>",Clara_dee

I've seen a lot of posts and comments saying that they ""only"" have 300, 400, 500 subs and it drives me nuts.

How do you guys with big numbers like that get so many paying subs? I get having that many on a free page but I see so many people say they have hundreds of paying subscribers, that's wild to me!

A few questions:

1.What do you do to get that many?

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from?

3. Did you start from a zero social media following?

4.  Are you conventionally attractive?

5.How much do you show when you promote? (Meaning showing tits, pussy, ass or do you stay fully covered?)

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

10. If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post?

Anyone else here have small numbers (less than 50 subs) ?",ik20t1p,"1. Definitely consistency, it‚Äôs important to keep up with promoting day by day. I also always have a sale on for the first month - this entices potential subscribers to subscribe right now while they are getting a discount. Of course if they have their rebill on they are charged the full amount in the next month/s.

2. Mostly Reddit. I‚Äôm trying to build my twitter also at the moment, and I am wanting to start TikTok also. But at the moment majority are reddit.

3. Yes, I started 2 years ago with 0 social media following. I don‚Äôt promote or give out any of my personal social media.

4. Yes, and i do think it helps. I won‚Äôt bullshit you. However it‚Äôs still important to take good photos, I like my makeup, hair done, nice lingerie ect. It‚Äôs important to look your best because the more upvotes/exposure = more potential subscribers.

5. I am fully covered on reddit, no nudity at all. My onlyfans I show topless on my page. Behind a PPV paywall i will sell pussy pics as well as sex content.

6. Big no, I only chat to subscribers. After all, they are paying me for that service, your time is not free ladies. I may occasionally reply to people on a reddit post that is doing really well, just to show that I‚Äôm a friendly person to entice them to sub.

I've seen a lot of posts and comments saying that they ""only"" have 300, 400, 500 subs and it drives me nuts.

How do you guys with big numbers like that get so many paying subs? I get having that many on a free page but I see so many people say they have hundreds of paying subscribers, that's wild to me!

A few questions:

1.What do you do to get that many?

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from?

3. Did you start from a zero social media following?

4.  Are you conventionally attractive?

5.How much do you show when you promote? (Meaning showing tits, pussy, ass or do you stay fully covered?)

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

10. If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post?

I've seen a lot of posts and comments saying that they ""only"" have 300, 400, 500 subs and it drives me nuts.

How do you guys with big numbers like that get so many paying subs? I get having that many on a free page but I see so many people say they have hundreds of paying subscribers, that's wild to me!

A few questions:

1.What do you do to get that many?

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from?

3. Did you start from a zero social media following?

4.  Are you conventionally attractive?

5.How much do you show when you promote? (Meaning showing tits, pussy, ass or do you stay fully covered?)

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

10. If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post?

1. IG reels and tiktok are my main promo so when a video goes viral you get a huge influx of subscribers (literally got 300+ subs from one IG reel that went viral)

I've seen a lot of posts and comments saying that they ""only"" have 300, 400, 500 subs and it drives me nuts.

How do you guys with big numbers like that get so many paying subs? I get having that many on a free page but I see so many people say they have hundreds of paying subscribers, that's wild to me!

A few questions:

1.What do you do to get that many?

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from?

3. Did you start from a zero social media following?

4.  Are you conventionally attractive?

5.How much do you show when you promote? (Meaning showing tits, pussy, ass or do you stay fully covered?)

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

10. If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post?

Anyone else here have small numbers (less than 50 subs) ?<|eost|><|sor u/Mspameliajj|>I have 5.6K fans,  Top 0.8%.

1. I have big boobs,  I'm also BBW
2. Tiktok -  I was getting millions of views but since been shadowbanned but if you persevere with it, you'll get a constant flow of subs.  I don't use any other platform to promote, I have instagram and Twitter just for the links.
3. I started with 0 social media presence
4. I would say I'm conventionally attractive to a certain niche
5. I show 0 nudity when promoting
6. I don't reply to Dms -  in my opinion, it's a waste of time
7. I show face
8. I had a free page and found it was useless, my suggestion is to always start a paid account first
9. I film one ppv a month,  usually boy/girl.

Not a reallyyyyy huge creator with 500+
I had around 20 subs the first two years I did onlyfans. I used to promote just on instagram. Then I started promoting on Reddit and got more people subscribing.

1-2. I now promote only on Reddit. I tried other platforms but doesn‚Äôt work well for me. I do sales often though like every weekend. If is really quiet and I see I don‚Äôt get many subs I do 50% off etc. It really depends if my posts on Reddit do well or not too.

3. Yes I started from zero on instagram in 2018 I had around 3k followers quite fast and 20-30 subs. But instagram kept deleting my pages so I just stopped. Reddit too started from 0.

4. I‚Äôm a white plus size woman with tattoos.

5. I do lingerie and topless for promos.

6. My Reddit dms are off since almost when I started. It was a huge waste of time.

7. Yes. I‚Äôve been thinking to do faceless promo but I still show face.

8. No I don‚Äôt anymore i used to and had around 3k subscribers but they just want freebies not many ended up subscribing to the paid one or buying stuff.

9. Yes but not many as I sometimes get lazy to film full length videos üòÖ

10. I post around twice a day I‚Äôm in Europe so figuring when to post is a bit annoying and sometimes doesn‚Äôt matter anyway. I post in niche subs (Bbw, chubby, big boobs‚Ä¶) I post in at least 4-5 subs every time.

I feel I could do better with promoting. Maybe making a TikTok but I‚Äôm not comfortable with the it yet<|eor|><|soopr u/Effective_Jellyfish|>Do you think your success was just a matter of time (and obviously promoting)?

It's mostly promotion, finding what works for you, trying new things/platforms, and a LOT of promotion. Some people do 100% reddit and are extremely successful but that just wasn't it for me personally.

1. IG reels and tiktok are my main promo so when a video goes viral you get a huge influx of subscribers (literally got 300+ subs from one IG reel that went viral)
2. I had a poll on my page for a while so I know that mine is like 60% IG reels, 30% tiktok, and 10% random things like twitter or old promos I did.
3. Yes started at zero
4. Yes and also chubby/BBW. There's a HUGE audience for chubby/BBW
5. As much as I can show on tiktok which is usually bikinis or that style
6. No, never. I did in the beginning but it's a huge time waster in my opinion and it always just made me mad.
7. I didn't for the first 10 months and started showing it after that. During those 10 months I was always around 50-100 subs and once I started showing it I got a lot more (not sure if it's directly related or not)
8. No my sub price is $9.99

I've seen a lot of posts and comments saying that they ""only"" have 300, 400, 500 subs and it drives me nuts.

How do you guys with big numbers like that get so many paying subs? I get having that many on a free page but I see so many people say they have hundreds of paying subscribers, that's wild to me!

A few questions:

1.What do you do to get that many?

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from?

3. Did you start from a zero social media following?

4.  Are you conventionally attractive?

5.How much do you show when you promote? (Meaning showing tits, pussy, ass or do you stay fully covered?)

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

Do you mean you're attracting cheap guys on your free page or also on your paid page? The free page will always be cheap guys wanting more for free which is why I think a lot of girls turn it to paid messaging. On my paid page people generally don't expect anything extra for free and I still have lots of people buying extra PPV.

Getting the really big spenders is a mix of just a numbers game and also showing your personality.

I've seen a lot of posts and comments saying that they ""only"" have 300, 400, 500 subs and it drives me nuts.

How do you guys with big numbers like that get so many paying subs? I get having that many on a free page but I see so many people say they have hundreds of paying subscribers, that's wild to me!

A few questions:

1.What do you do to get that many?

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from?

3. Did you start from a zero social media following?

4.  Are you conventionally attractive?

5.How much do you show when you promote? (Meaning showing tits, pussy, ass or do you stay fully covered?)

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

10. If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post?

Anyone else here have small numbers (less than 50 subs) ?<|eost|><|sor u/EmmaLane_|>It seemed totally impossible for me to get to that level but then I did! It's mostly promotion, finding what works for you, trying new things/platforms, and a LOT of promotion. Some people do 100% reddit and are extremely successful but that just wasn't it for me personally.

1. IG reels and tiktok are my main promo so when a video goes viral you get a huge influx of subscribers (literally got 300+ subs from one IG reel that went viral)
2. I had a poll on my page for a while so I know that mine is like 60% IG reels, 30% tiktok, and 10% random things like twitter or old promos I did.
3. Yes started at zero
4. Yes and also chubby/BBW. There's a HUGE audience for chubby/BBW
5. As much as I can show on tiktok which is usually bikinis or that style
6. No, never. I did in the beginning but it's a huge time waster in my opinion and it always just made me mad.
7. I didn't for the first 10 months and started showing it after that. During those 10 months I was always around 50-100 subs and once I started showing it I got a lot more (not sure if it's directly related or not)
8. No my sub price is $9.99
9. Yep I do! I have shorter videos for $5.99 and longer (7-12 mins) for $9.99
10. I don't use reddit anymore<|eor|><|soopr u/Effective_Jellyfish|>Thank you so much.
I have thought about tiktok but I'm terrified of showing up on families fyp...
I have blocked the ones I know but still freaks me out. I have thought about going faceless tho.

Ig reels has the same issue I don't wanna pop up on someone's recommends that could spoil the fun for me lol

Reddit feels safer for me.

It is so encouraging to read so many successful BBWs!

I want to get higher numbers....my sub price is $9.99 also

I have a free page that's newish and have over 200 subs there I have had people subscribe from there because they ""couldn't help it"" I have no ppv on my paid. I make a little from ppv from my free

I seem to attract cheap guys, any advice on how to attract dudes who wanna spend?

Almost all the DMs I respond to for free really seem to expect me to give it all away for free...

They really seem to think they are the special guy that is gonna get everything for free and just seem to think I'm gonna send pics vids and sexting for nothing....like don't get me wrong this IS fun but like I had one guy question if my free page really is free!!!


 I turned my DMs on because no one was tipping to message on my free onlyfans. I made a little money there but on reddit they just want everything for free, kind of drives me nuts

FYI some people think this is my promoting reddit, I promise this account I share thirst posts of men is not my promoting account lmao.<|eoopr|><|sor u/EmmaLane_|>I blocked the ones I know on tiktok too but it's definitely still scary, I get it!!

Anyone else here have small numbers (less than 50 subs) ?<|eost|><|sor u/Zoe_Riot|>I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off rude but being ‚Äúconventionally attractive‚Äù has nothing to do with it. That is literally perspective and opinion. There are models of all types doing well and not doing well. What matters is how much work you put into your page and how serious you take the business. People might look at my page and think I have hundreds of fans but I don‚Äôt. What I do have though is a very dedicated fan base that I plan to build onto, just haven‚Äôt had the motivation to hard Promote lately so my numbers have dropped. I Built what I have over the past couple years and take my presentation very seriously Ava have spent a ton of time on my online persona. I just wanted to say this because I truly don‚Äôt like people thinking that just because someone is ‚Äúpretty‚Äù (which again, perspective) that they don‚Äôt have to work as hard. It‚Äôs absolutely not true and it creates a false narrative for this type of work.<|eor|><|sor u/awholemessadessa|>‚ÄúConventionally attractive‚Äù does have something to do with it. I implore you to see it similar to music and how it charts. Music with lyrics in English have a much better chance at charting because more people speak English than let‚Äôs say, patois. Does that mean Beyonce didn‚Äôt work hard to have her most recent album debut at number 1 on the billboard 200? No. If a dancehall album peaked at #50 on the same chart does that mean the artist is more successful and worked harder than Beyonce? No.

The ‚Äúconventional‚Äù part in conventionally attractive literally means a set of agreed, stipulated, or generally accepted standards. Those standards are depicted in the media and even more on reddit. Just sort a nsfw subreddit like r/ ass by hot lol. Someone being conventionally attractive is *so* relevant that in order to make a ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how I made it to the top xyz%‚Äù post that doesn‚Äôt get deleted within 24 hours, you have to describe your niche/body type.<|eor|><|sor u/Zoe_Riot|>I‚Äôm sorry but you can‚Äôt compare the music industry to the porn industry.

 I turned my DMs on because no one was tipping to message on my free onlyfans. I made a little money there but on reddit they just want everything for free, kind of drives me nuts

FYI some people think this is my promoting reddit, I promise this account I share thirst posts of men is not my promoting account lmao.<|eoopr|><|sor u/EmmaLane_|>I blocked the ones I know on tiktok too but it's definitely still scary, I get it!! I only started showing my face once I realized I didn't really care if people knew and I told my mom and my sister about it. But even during the 10 months of no face (and once I started showing my face 4 months ago) I've never had anyone find out about it or see any viral videos. At least no one has told me hahah.

Do you mean you're attracting cheap guys on your free page or also on your paid page? The free page will always be cheap guys wanting more for free which is why I think a lot of girls turn it to paid messaging. On my paid page people generally don't expect anything extra for free and I still have lots of people buying extra PPV.

Getting the really big spenders is a mix of just a numbers game and also showing your personality. The more subs you get the more likely you'll get a big spender, but also those are usually the ones who want to feel like they know you. I try to show my personality on Twitter and on my OF page and they really like that!<|eor|><|soopr u/Effective_Jellyfish|>Attracting cheap guys on my free page.

I've seen a lot of posts and comments saying that they ""only"" have 300, 400, 500 subs and it drives me nuts.

How do you guys with big numbers like that get so many paying subs? I get having that many on a free page but I see so many people say they have hundreds of paying subscribers, that's wild to me!

A few questions:

1.What do you do to get that many?

2. Where do you think you got your majority of subs from?

3. Did you start from a zero social media following?

4.  Are you conventionally attractive?

5.How much do you show when you promote? (Meaning showing tits, pussy, ass or do you stay fully covered?)

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

10. If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post?

Anyone else here have small numbers (less than 50 subs) ?<|eost|><|sor u/Zoe_Riot|>I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off rude but being ‚Äúconventionally attractive‚Äù has nothing to do with it. That is literally perspective and opinion. There are models of all types doing well and not doing well. What matters is how much work you put into your page and how serious you take the business. People might look at my page and think I have hundreds of fans but I don‚Äôt. What I do have though is a very dedicated fan base that I plan to build onto, just haven‚Äôt had the motivation to hard Promote lately so my numbers have dropped. I Built what I have over the past couple years and take my presentation very seriously Ava have spent a ton of time on my online persona. I just wanted to say this because I truly don‚Äôt like people thinking that just because someone is ‚Äúpretty‚Äù (which again, perspective) that they don‚Äôt have to work as hard. It‚Äôs absolutely not true and it creates a false narrative for this type of work.<|eor|><|sor u/awholemessadessa|>‚ÄúConventionally attractive‚Äù does have something to do with it. I implore you to see it similar to music and how it charts. Music with lyrics in English have a much better chance at charting because more people speak English than let‚Äôs say, patois. Does that mean Beyonce didn‚Äôt work hard to have her most recent album debut at number 1 on the billboard 200? No. If a dancehall album peaked at #50 on the same chart does that mean the artist is more successful and worked harder than Beyonce? No.

The ‚Äúconventional‚Äù part in conventionally attractive literally means a set of agreed, stipulated, or generally accepted standards. Those standards are depicted in the media and even more on reddit. Just sort a nsfw subreddit like r/ ass by hot lol. Someone being conventionally attractive is *so* relevant that in order to make a ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how I made it to the top xyz%‚Äù post that doesn‚Äôt get deleted within 24 hours, you have to describe your niche/body type.<|eor|><|sor u/Zoe_Riot|>I‚Äôm sorry but you can‚Äôt compare the music industry to the porn industry. ESPECIALLY modern day porn which is mostly amateur porn that is popular right now. Most men are not looking for a conventionally attractive woman although they may seem to get tons of upvotes, that all depends on the subreddit you‚Äôre looking at. And you absolutely cannot base everything off of Reddit. The porn industry is huge and in my opinion and being in the industry for 8+ years, the people with the quickest and most success are the ones who fit into specific niches easily and those who start off with lots of money. Money = higher quality equipment and supplies which = more ability to make themselves look good to their audience which also equals more attention in general. And also, conventionally attractive is subjective and highly depends on where a person is from and what is considered the beauty standard within that area.<|eor|><|sor u/awholemessadessa|>I really wish you‚Äôd listen more instead of getting defensive when literally nobody attacked you.

It's mostly promotion, finding what works for you, trying new things/platforms, and a LOT of promotion. Some people do 100% reddit and are extremely successful but that just wasn't it for me personally.

1. IG reels and tiktok are my main promo so when a video goes viral you get a huge influx of subscribers (literally got 300+ subs from one IG reel that went viral)
2. I had a poll on my page for a while so I know that mine is like 60% IG reels, 30% tiktok, and 10% random things like twitter or old promos I did.
3. Yes started at zero
4. Yes and also chubby/BBW. There's a HUGE audience for chubby/BBW
5. As much as I can show on tiktok which is usually bikinis or that style
6. No, never. I did in the beginning but it's a huge time waster in my opinion and it always just made me mad.
7. I didn't for the first 10 months and started showing it after that. During those 10 months I was always around 50-100 subs and once I started showing it I got a lot more (not sure if it's directly related or not)
8. No my sub price is $9.99
9. Yep I do! I have shorter videos for $5.99 and longer (7-12 mins) for $9.99
10. I don't use reddit anymore<|eor|><|soopr u/Effective_Jellyfish|>Thank you so much.
I have thought about tiktok but I'm terrified of showing up on families fyp...
I have blocked the ones I know but still freaks me out. I have thought about going faceless tho.

Ig reels has the same issue I don't wanna pop up on someone's recommends that could spoil the fun for me lol

Reddit feels safer for me.

It is so encouraging to read so many successful BBWs!

I want to get higher numbers....my sub price is $9.99 also

I have a free page that's newish and have over 200 subs there I have had people subscribe from there because they ""couldn't help it"" I have no ppv on my paid. I make a little from ppv from my free

6. Do you talk to potential customers in your social media DMs?

7. Do you show face?

8. Do you have a free page?

9. Do you sell PPV?

10. If you use reddit to promote, how often a day do you post?

Anyone else here have small numbers (less than 50 subs) ?<|eost|><|sor u/innapropriate_v|>1. Tik tok, Instagram, Reddit, stream as cam girl
2. A lot of them don‚Äôt tell me how they found me, but I think all the sources bring about same amount
3. Yes, I didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúwork‚Äù social media, but I was streaming as cam girl, so my first few fans and most loyal ones are the ones who were my stream regulars
4. Yes, but I have small boobs B cup lol
5. In Reddit recently started post nude - tits and pussy with closed legs standing, not like open wide; obviously no nudity in tik tok and insta
6. No, never whatsoever
7. Yes
8. Recently started it but it‚Äôs meh, I don‚Äôt put too much effort into it. Paid page is my main focus, it‚Äôs $7.5.
9. Yes
10. Very much varies, currently trying to stick to 10 subreddits in the USA morning and 10 before my bed time<|eor|><|soopr u/Effective_Jellyfish|>I wonder if camming helps a lot?

You need to build up your regulars and whatever ratings each site has. Also need different set up - PC or lap top/camera/interactive toys/mic/light/cam room. I wouldn‚Äôt do camming only as way to promote Onlyfans, it‚Äôs totally separate and gaining some fans is just side effect. I was camming since 2013 with break for 2-2.5 years I think, before OF was a thing.<|eor|><|soopr u/Effective_Jellyfish|>I don't think camming is for me but that's interesting<|eoopr|><|sor u/innapropriate_v|>I now stream as cam girl on weekends, and on the weekdays doing all Onlyfans related work.<|eor|><|soopr u/Effective_Jellyfish|>Do you love it?<|eoopr|><|sor u/innapropriate_v|>Yeah, I now don‚Äôt do anything that I really dislike or I don‚Äôt go live if I‚Äôm in bad mood or sick.

my labia minora is longer, textured and sticks out so i felt insecure about it. i considered getting a labiaplasty

but a lot of fans on onlyfans said they really like how my pussy looks, a few going to far to call it ""perfect"" or ""beautiful"" which was just wild to me. i thought everyone preferred a tucked in innie pussy and that i would get hate comments about how ugly mine is but i never have. so that definitely helped with my insecurity around that part of me<|eor|><|sor u/AprilCutieBooty|>Literally exactly the same!

I‚Äôve been consistent on all platforms, and some of my TikToks have done really well (like millions of views), but I am just not seeing conversion to paid subs.

Part of this is inflation, summer, the economy, etc, however, there is always money to be made‚Ä¶.which means I needed to evolve my strategies.


To try to get more subs in, I did a variety of sales on my sub price, but I still wasn‚Äôt seeing that many new subs.  So I decided to try a new strategy.  I read that one business strategy is to market your free page, and then on your free page, market your paid page.

Since my pages weren‚Äôt performing optimally, I decided to give it a try.  Not all business models work for everyone, but I figured it was a great time to try and change things up given my page not doing its best and the state of the world.


I am now funneling ALL of my social media to my free onlyfans page.  By doing this, I have increased my number of free subs dramatically, going from about 3.5k free fans to 5.8k free fans in a matter of a week.  I also put a sale price on my VIP page.  However, this did not translate to more paid subs or more income.


To get more sales on my free page, I decided to lower the prices on my paid posts and provide a lot more low price content and bundles.  Doing this has increased sales on my free page and made me more money than my free page normally brings in, but it‚Äôs still not optimal for me to say I‚Äôm confident in keeping this strategy.


I‚Äôm going to give this strategy more time to see if it works before I go back to advertising only my paid page.  It‚Äôs been a bit more work in the sense that I‚Äôm kind of revamping my free page gradually, but I‚Äôm hoping it pays off.

Another update from me.  As you know, I like to give you a peek into top creator struggles.  I was .7% for the past few months, and this past week, I have fallen to 1%.  I‚Äôve been consistent on all platforms, and some of my TikToks have done really well (like millions of views), but I am just not seeing conversion to paid subs.  In addition, my current subs, even my best supporting subs, are just not as active or spending.  Part of this is inflation, summer, the economy, etc, however, there is always money to be made‚Ä¶.which means I needed to evolve my strategies.


To try to get more subs in, I did a variety of sales on my sub price, but I still wasn‚Äôt seeing that many new subs.  So I decided to try a new strategy.  I read that one business strategy is to market your free page, and then on your free page, market your paid page.  On your paid page, the majority of your money should be coming from PPV rather than subscriptions, so you should have run sale price for your sub fee.  Since my pages weren‚Äôt performing optimally, I decided to give it a try.  Not all business models work for everyone, but I figured it was a great time to try and change things up given my page not doing its best and the state of the world.


I am now funneling ALL of my social media to my free onlyfans page.  By doing this, I have increased my number of free subs dramatically, going from about 3.5k free fans to 5.8k free fans in a matter of a week.  I also put a sale price on my VIP page.  However, this did not translate to more paid subs or more income.


To get more sales on my free page, I decided to lower the prices on my paid posts and provide a lot more low price content and bundles.  Doing this has increased sales on my free page and made me more money than my free page normally brings in, but it‚Äôs still not optimal for me to say I‚Äôm confident in keeping this strategy.


I‚Äôm going to give this strategy more time to see if it works before I go back to advertising only my paid page.  It‚Äôs been a bit more work in the sense that I‚Äôm kind of revamping my free page gradually, but I‚Äôm hoping it pays off.

As you know, I like to give you a peek into top creator struggles.  I was .7% for the past few months, and this past week, I have fallen to 1%.  I‚Äôve been consistent on all platforms, and some of my TikToks have done really well (like millions of views), but I am just not seeing conversion to paid subs.  In addition, my current subs, even my best supporting subs, are just not as active or spending.  Part of this is inflation, summer, the economy, etc, however, there is always money to be made‚Ä¶.which means I needed to evolve my strategies.


To try to get more subs in, I did a variety of sales on my sub price, but I still wasn‚Äôt seeing that many new subs.  So I decided to try a new strategy.  I read that one business strategy is to market your free page, and then on your free page, market your paid page.  On your paid page, the majority of your money should be coming from PPV rather than subscriptions, so you should have run sale price for your sub fee.  Since my pages weren‚Äôt performing optimally, I decided to give it a try.  Not all business models work for everyone, but I figured it was a great time to try and change things up given my page not doing its best and the state of the world.


I am now funneling ALL of my social media to my free onlyfans page.  By doing this, I have increased my number of free subs dramatically, going from about 3.5k free fans to 5.8k free fans in a matter of a week.  I also put a sale price on my VIP page.  However, this did not translate to more paid subs or more income.


To get more sales on my free page, I decided to lower the prices on my paid posts and provide a lot more low price content and bundles.  Doing this has increased sales on my free page and made me more money than my free page normally brings in, but it‚Äôs still not optimal for me to say I‚Äôm confident in keeping this strategy.


I‚Äôm going to give this strategy more time to see if it works before I go back to advertising only my paid page.  It‚Äôs been a bit more work in the sense that I‚Äôm kind of revamping my free page gradually, but I‚Äôm hoping it pays off.

Do not expect to make bank from this if you are not working at it a loooot. I began and had a part time job and quit that within a month to make more money.

‚ú® A lot of creators lie about how much they make or their percentage. If I had of known this I would of most likely not done this. If you sit at a percentage above 1% you are not making a great deal of money really, I know that may make some people annoyed but if you equal out whatever you earn a month to a weekly pay it‚Äôs often just an average wage or less for so much work.

‚ú® No matter what you look like, you will be fetishised or hated for your appearance. This job can take really take a toll on you mentally. I am 56kg and have a bit of butt and have been called fat so many times during this past year, I have never had that happen to me in ‚Äòreal life‚Äô. People will abuse you for no real reason based on your occupation.

‚ú® Making content or talking to some subs is fun but your job is essentially being a promoter and that fucking sucks, it really does. You will lose social media accounts continuously, get mean comments, be shadowbanned, make 10 million different TikTok accounts and still not make as much as someone else for reasons you can‚Äôt really understand.

‚ú® No OF page is hot all the time, you will have weeks you get a lot of subs and love this and then you will go through stages where no one is subbing. I learnt this by watching larger free pages and subbing to accounts that were popular and noticed some got thousands of likes but really seemed to not make much in tips. Look at some big twitch streamers OF‚Äôs and you will see thousands in tips last year and a few hundred now.

‚ú® You will be leaked and if you use reddit you are leaking yourself, you may not care and be happy about the promotion but maybe in the future you will feel differently. DMCA takedown services will not take everything down. Decide for you if it‚Äôs worth what you earn on OF.

Sorry if this is just a ramble üòÇ<|eot|><|sost|>I have now done OF for just over a year, I began not long after turning 18 as my background is not very wealthy and I hoped to make the amount some other creators do. The highest I have ever been is 1.7% and hover between 2-4% usually. Here‚Äôs some things I have learnt and want to pass onto new creators.

‚ú® This is hard work. This is much harder work than having a full time job if you really want to make money. You are an editor, marketer, entertainer, therapist and much more. Do not expect to make bank from this if you are not working at it a loooot. I began and had a part time job and quit that within a month to make more money.

‚ú® A lot of creators lie about how much they make or their percentage. If I had of known this I would of most likely not done this. If you sit at a percentage above 1% you are not making a great deal of money really, I know that may make some people annoyed but if you equal out whatever you earn a month to a weekly pay it‚Äôs often just an average wage or less for so much work.

‚ú® No matter what you look like, you will be fetishised or hated for your appearance. This job can take really take a toll on you mentally. I am 56kg and have a bit of butt and have been called fat so many times during this past year, I have never had that happen to me in ‚Äòreal life‚Äô. People will abuse you for no real reason based on your occupation.

‚ú® Making content or talking to some subs is fun but your job is essentially being a promoter and that fucking sucks, it really does. You will lose social media accounts continuously, get mean comments, be shadowbanned, make 10 million different TikTok accounts and still not make as much as someone else for reasons you can‚Äôt really understand.

‚ú® No OF page is hot all the time, you will have weeks you get a lot of subs and love this and then you will go through stages where no one is subbing. I learnt this by watching larger free pages and subbing to accounts that were popular and noticed some got thousands of likes but really seemed to not make much in tips. Look at some big twitch streamers OF‚Äôs and you will see thousands in tips last year and a few hundred now.

‚ú® You will be leaked and if you use reddit you are leaking yourself, you may not care and be happy about the promotion but maybe in the future you will feel differently. DMCA takedown services will not take everything down. Decide for you if it‚Äôs worth what you earn on OF.


Not sure really what the point of this post is, I just believe there could be more transparency in how people talk about their OF experience. I know my statistic is not the highest but the fact I‚Äôm there tells me I have done ok in my first year, which also tells me that the news articles and public perception that OF makes you good money is wrong.<|eost|><|sor u/Odd_Angle5182|>I think you nailed it. It totally irritates me seeing others lie about their % and it gives false hope and also makes those who are honest about % or earnings come across as dishonest when they actually aren't.  I had a tiktok go well this week about how much money I made last month selling pics of my taco online. After a while most of the comments were women asking me for help to be able to do it too as I am sure they think it's just easy money. The amount of work and effort to truly make top % is a LOT unless you are coming into it with a public profile and pre-existing large following.  I got to 0.5% legitimately a few months ago and have since dropped back to around 1% but it's still a huge amount of work and 90% of it is about marketing and thinking about how you can attract, extract (money from existing subs) and retain subs.

If you use iPhone, the recent IOS update has potentially updated your default location settings. It is in the small print but most people don‚Äôt even click to open it.

Precise location is exactly what it sounds like. It enables social media (and therefore users/followers that try hard enough) to gather your PRECISE location.

To check the settings you have enabled:

Caveat: the vast, vast majority of sexual assaults, stalking, harassment, threatening, etc are done in domestic violence situations; NOT, random internet strangers. Sure, be cautious of strange men. But your biggest threat is always going to be an intimate partner. Source: 10+ years as a first responder.<|eor|><|sor u/thegoodtimegirl|>Also AI is developing constantly. I‚Äôm sure after some years search engines can look for you just based on your face even if the images are not similar. It might eventually be possible that AI can identify bodies too.<|eor|><|sor u/bitchtits08|>It‚Äôs already there. Your face can be recognized through a mask. People make it easy by being too lazy to sign in to anything, and willingly give their phones permission to do Face ID with a mask on so they can quickly access whatever they want. Body identifiers have been around for a LONG time, so yes, AI technology is already there. As is reverse image search.

My point to this was nicely as possibly telling creators that they‚Äôre living a huge lie if they think they‚Äôre ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and ‚Äúno one‚Äù can find them.<|eor|><|sor u/thegoodtimegirl|>The reverse image searches don‚Äôt work super well yet.  They can only find very similar images.

I agree there‚Äôs no way to hide. The best thing is really to make address and phone numbers secret (if it‚Äôs possible in your country). That way if you get doxxed they at least can‚Äôt get your home address. Unless they hack one of your accounts ofc.<|eor|><|sor u/bitchtits08|>You‚Äôre only kidding yourself if you think reverse image searches don‚Äôt work that well. Try it out for yourself and see how easy it is to find you. That‚Äôs my entire point. You can try to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù yourself as best as possible but the only TRUE protection is not doing online sex work. Period, point blank.

Again, the bigger threat to your safety is an intimate partner. More women (and men) are killed by lovers/exes/spouses/boyfriends/girlfriends/etc than they are by strangers.<|eor|><|sor u/thegoodtimegirl|>Maybe it‚Äôs just because I have different hair now, but it can‚Äôt really find anything. Also some other people I‚Äôve tried it couldn‚Äôt really get any good results. I didn‚Äôt try with Yandex tho. Apparently it‚Äôs better.

Ofc. Also family members and friends are a bigger threat than strangers. I still will do all I can to protect myself from harassment.<|eor|><|endoftext|>",thegoodtimegirl

I don‚Äôt feel comfortable, nor is it fair, to message them years after our friendship ended to ask them to go through their thousands of FB photos and delete any picture of me in it because i‚Äôve started sex work and i‚Äôm paranoid about people finding my personal info lol

An example: Say you had an old HS friend you haven‚Äôt spoken to since 18. Their FB is public, as is their 45 photo albums. A crazed sub reverse image searches a photo of your face from your sfw OF instagram. The search matches your face to one of the photos of your old friends photo albums from 2007. The caption says ‚Äòi‚Äôm so glad i had these girls to get me through high school‚Äô. This friend has her high school public on her FB. That crazed sub now knows the high school you went to and the town you live(d) in. It‚Äôs that easy.

I‚Äôm extra paranoid about this stuff but i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad thing. I feel like creeps often target SWs, hopefully mainly its online threats, but I think we should treat it as if they are an irl threat",ij7mkcr,"Yup.

She is a faceless creator, and based on what I‚Äôve seen from the tweets still up, she was doxxed based on a picture with a distinct piece of property that she owns. Please remember to give your pictures a second look over before posting to ensure you don‚Äôt have something identifiable in the image.<|eost|><|sor u/bitchtits08|>I know this is a risky move, but I go by my real first name. Bitchtits08 is on all of my socials, including my OnlyFans, but so is Farren. I don‚Äôt hide my name. I say New England as where I live. None of it is a lie. Sure, I‚Äôll show people my asshole, but I won‚Äôt tell them my last name. HOWEVER, I‚Äôve been a first responder for 10+ years. People WILL find you if they want to. So I figured, I‚Äôd give up what I felt comfortable releasing. There are people that I KNOW in real life that are subscribed to me, and plenty who chose to do so but remain anonymous. Again? I work on the belief system (because of my actual job) that people WILL find you if they want to.

*This is the comment that‚Äôll probably get me downvoted to shit* - whether you are faceless or not, whether you use VPN‚Äôs or not, whether you use your name or not, whether you made new ‚Äúfake‚Äù emails/socials/etc, got burner phones, etc - if someone wants to find you, they will and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. I think there are way too many creators (men and women, but ESPECIALLY women) that don‚Äôt realize you are putting yourself out there on the internet, forever. You cannot hide, despite your best efforts. Your precautions are merely a smoke screen so you feel safer, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you are safer.

Caveat: the vast, vast majority of sexual assaults, stalking, harassment, threatening, etc are done in domestic violence situations; NOT, random internet strangers. Sure, be cautious of strange men. But your biggest threat is always going to be an intimate partner. Source: 10+ years as a first responder.<|eor|><|sor u/thegoodtimegirl|>Also AI is developing constantly. I‚Äôm sure after some years search engines can look for you just based on your face even if the images are not similar. It might eventually be possible that AI can identify bodies too.<|eor|><|sor u/bitchtits08|>It‚Äôs already there. Your face can be recognized through a mask. People make it easy by being too lazy to sign in to anything, and willingly give their phones permission to do Face ID with a mask on so they can quickly access whatever they want. Body identifiers have been around for a LONG time, so yes, AI technology is already there. As is reverse image search.

My point to this was nicely as possibly telling creators that they‚Äôre living a huge lie if they think they‚Äôre ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and ‚Äúno one‚Äù can find them.<|eor|><|sor u/thegoodtimegirl|>The reverse image searches don‚Äôt work super well yet.  They can only find very similar images.

I agree there‚Äôs no way to hide. The best thing is really to make address and phone numbers secret (if it‚Äôs possible in your country). That way if you get doxxed they at least can‚Äôt get your home address. Unless they hack one of your accounts ofc.<|eor|><|sor u/URCcats-tt|>I disagree. A sub found a picture of me from an ex-company website i worked for, and he sent it to me to threaten me. I got so freaked out because I was so sure I‚Äôd scrubbed every image of me from the internet pre OF.

I paid ¬£30 for a popular reverse image search site to search myself and see what I found. I found multiple pictures of me (some from when I wasn‚Äôt even 18 üò≥), that i had posted on IG and tumbl R etc on random websites. I had fully deleted these pics and accounts from the actual websites but they‚Äôd ended up somewhere else. My face was even obscured by my hair in some pictures, some taken from far away and kind of grainy, and also my face was 8+ years younger in some of the pics‚Ä¶

I wouldn‚Äôt be naive to how advanced these things are<|eor|><|sor u/bitchtits08|>Exactly!! I‚Äôm so sorry it happened. But it does happen. ESPECIALLY for those of us that were around for the start of the internet. You can scrub whatever you want; you‚Äôre not getting it all. I sure as fuck don‚Äôt remember ALL the stupid shit I posted when I was 15/16/17. MySpace, anyone?? AIM was another huge one. Chat rooms?? ASL?? So much data out there that you can‚Äôt get to because it doesn‚Äôt exist not, but it didn‚Äôt go away. A BIG one to remember too, all these websites have leaks. You can delete the source, but you can‚Äôt find every place it‚Äôs out there on.<|eor|><|sor u/URCcats-tt|>Exactly!! Trying to remember every pic you posted is not happening.

She‚Äôs known for doing this kind of stuff. She‚Äôs a fake ass person. Celebrities are very rarely who we want them to be in our heads.

What I was saying is that she will have a tough time proving the girl did anything to damage her reputation since she herself snapped the screenshot.

And yes, that seems like a super weird number. I think she just includes her free subs in the total with her paid subs because she has like 20k on her free page and that combined with the 10k -which I believe are likely mostly other creators- makes up 30k.

I replied to a post in the onlyfans reviews group earlier as I saw someone asking for a creator who could do taboo Mommy daughter content‚Ä¶. It astounded me to see 30+ replies offering to do this. I‚Äôd say a fair few don‚Äôt realise this is in fact incest and goes against the terms of use on Onlyfans and you can have your account banned for this. As someone who has had their account gone through multiple times by admins and had posts and messages removed and deleted for even referring to fisting or squirting and forgetting to tag a co-creator in a PPV DM‚Ä¶. A reminder to please take the time to read the terms of use. It‚Äôs not worth the risk losing your accoun.<|eost|><|sor u/Rylie_Rowan|>Honestly OF is wayyyy less strict when it comes to incest compared to other kinks that are also against TOS like public play and bodily fluids. I don't think it's something to worry about. At most you'll get a warning. If you're really worried you can put ""step"" in the title. My niche is step content . When i make a step dad vid, I just say ""step"" in the title and say daddy for the rest of the vid. Daddy just sounds better than step dad.

 Like, there are literally b/g accounts that are like ""real mom and son"" with hundreds of thousands of likes that get away with it because they only say that in their name. There are multiple I've seen of  big accounts like this that are clearly like 1%. And they literally make full on porn together. I doubt they're telling the truth but OF does not give a fuck about incest lol. and And so many 1% popular creators that are twins that do sexual stuff right next each other lol<|eor|><|soopr u/Odd_Angle5182|>Well personally I‚Äôve been under top 1% since Dec
last year and am not willing to take the risk. Step content different. As soon as a sub asks about customs where the role play involves a minor as my child, it‚Äôs a no go zone for me. If police ever investigated you are basically contributing to someone into pedophilia and it is way beyond an OF TOS/inferred incest issue. The whole point of my post was a heads up to be more aware of potential issues. Seems to me based on some replies it‚Äôs a case of others do it so it must be ok.<|eoopr|><|sor u/Rylie_Rowan|>Oh they wanted the daughter to be a minor? Oh that's definitely a no.<|eor|><|soopr u/Odd_Angle5182|>They didn‚Äôt specify in this instance but I would bet that‚Äôs the inference.  When someone says they want taboo mother daughter content surely that‚Äôs a red flag.<|eoopr|><|sor u/Rylie_Rowan|>All legal step-dad/ step mom porn is with an 18 year old or a young adult so I don't see your point.

Builds a lil community, keeps me in people‚Äôs minds who already have decided they like me, and I think it has a higher conversion rate for me compared to posting in other subs.

Of course other people also say to post in subs that fit your body type, your niche, your interests, etc. Also all very important.<|eor|><|endoftext|>",zittyandsexxi

Once you find ones that work just consistently post there. It takes time but I‚Äôm solely advertising here now and it seems to be working.

Nah, followers want that quality content in order to get reeled in etc. Gets tiring doing that all the time especially if you‚Äôre solo.<|eor|><|endoftext|>",reinanina

TikTok has been great for me a few times where I received hundreds of subs but just good other times and awful the rest where I might get 2/3 subs. As an OF creator you need to make new accounts all the time on TT which itself it‚Äôs so annoying, I really think to make good money you would need to make a new account every week at least and have the others running too. You watch as other creators are verified and get their entire foot out without any violation.

People are rude all the time. 
Been doing this for about a year and today is the first time I have really cried about what someone said to me. 
It makes me want to raise my price because at least it will be worth the strain on my mental health. 
Sometimes ""potential customers"" treat us like absolute trash and some days it really hurts. 

On the other end I really enjoy what I do. I am turned on by the fact that my body gives people pleasure. 

I seem to make people's days a little better. 

I enjoy talking to my subscribers and the ones I have are really sweet. 

So many people don't seem to realise we do this to help pay the bills. 

I wouldn't want to go back to working a normal job though, I really like making money this way. 

I guess like with everything else, there is ups and downs<|eor|><|endoftext|>",Violet_girl92

I have found my niches and actually enjoy the creating content and getting cute for it but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just the same over and over. If you do this full time you probably understand how I feel. 

I did reddit for months before TikTok, posting 50 times a day all different content and also made content that was different for my page. It took hours and you are met with rude comments and rude mods for 10 subs a day. People follow you just to abuse you. 

TikTok has been great for me a few times where I received hundreds of subs but just good other times and awful the rest where I might get 2/3 subs. As an OF creator you need to make new accounts all the time on TT which itself it‚Äôs so annoying, I really think to make good money you would need to make a new account every week at least and have the others running too. You watch as other creators are verified and get their entire foot out without any violation.

My earnings in order are- Subscriptions, Tips (customs, sexting, live stream, post tips, campaign tips), and PPV. I have amazing and loyal subs that make this job, not only loads of fun and something I‚Äôve never experienced before, but sustainable for me as a single mom. 
Edit- I post at least one-4 times a day. Every Like milestone gets a video dropped to my wall as well. If it ends in 500, it‚Äôs a 5 min or less video; if it ends in 000, it‚Äôs a 10 min video (sometimes longer)<|eor|><|endoftext|>",Recent_Pattern_5424

Those of you who prove at $5-$8, what type of stuff do you post on your wall? Mostly topless or nude pics?
 All the goods, even say 5min long vids? Or just like, teaser clips of those then send the full as a ppv? Do you all post semi-everyday activities pics or short clips but with a naughty twist?(ex: coming in your undies lol)

You see, whenever things look bleak, men and women of all times and ages have been driven into conflict and into the beautiful and sensual to scape reality, porn will never go away, porn will even become more mainstream in the future, that's a fact, ppl will consume adult content no matter what, problem is, PPV and PAID content is getting a hit over mass produced cheap stuff, or rehash of the rehash, OF provided a niche where you could actually interact with your fans and even forge friendships, but sadly as some of my fans have told me, please lower your prices I cant afford to be subscribed at the current price point, I'm broke, and have other stuff to pay before my cyber sensual drugs.

I can empathize with the feeling, but its also a business for us and we cant devalue our content and or brand, because lets face it, if you have been in here for a while, even if you've kept your fanbase happy and fed, you will take a financial hit.

The coming months years will get more crazy in this regard, so I have a suggestion of something that has worked out for me, cocreate, cocreate, cocreate, let me explain.

We have to upscale and add even more value than the personal touch, big producers will eat us up unless we fight back and escalate our production values our networking and our content.

We began working on this when the apocalypse hit a few years ago, we had the knowhow and the equipment, but knew nothing of this, (we are still learning), we were lucky and partnered with a friend that taught us much but had little production value, we upped her video and quality production game and she appeared in ours and they where hits, we then paired with another friend, and being there some of our creator friends said that they would have never ever considered a cocreation with the other creator friend because of how she looked, we all made some amazing videos together that we rebounded, they trusted the process of splitting the content into 3 parts with 3 main protagonists per split, thing is we all had to let go of our hubris and fear of soling the spotlight to grow and cash in with more quality and production values!

go out for coffee with another creators you like their stuff, see how you vibe, 4 pairs of feet sell more than 1 in our experience

Our video was a success, we all benefited and now every few months we get together and create some steamy stuff we are all looking forward to! 

Diversify your content , up the ante, buy some lights, get a dedicated camera instead of a phone, and if you find willing trustworthy co creators and collabs, cherish and keep them, because offering only solo content will get more difficult to move  and monetize!

hi everyone! i'm looking for an accountability buddy that is interested in texting about our progress daily, talking about what we did that day in regards to posting, creating content, promoting, sharing things we learn along the way and tips. overall i'd love to have someone to share their experience and to whom i can share mine as well. 

although this can also mean a new sw friend, i want this to be most of all a way of creating accountability and motivation for both of us, so it would be best if you also struggle with being consistent or if you are doing great with that and want to help someone who struggles a lot! lol

i'm sharing a little about myself and my ups and downs with this job and if you feel like we have a similar experience please leave a comment so we can chat! i really feel like this could help both of us actually get things done so i'm willing to chat a little and find someone to click with.

so anyways!! my name is emi and i'm in the alternative/goth/emo/whatever you wanna call it niche (this is my of acc so you can find some pics on my profile!). i'm vegan and i'd love to branch out to making recipe tiktoks, twitch lives and even youtube videos (that would be more like a hobby i've always wanted to do but i've figured it could be great promo as well). i'm into somewhat ""alternative"" music so i believe this could also be a great niche to go for. 
i love using my personal twitter and i feel like i could fit the ""e-girl"" niche but i have a *really* hard time being consistent, interacting and simply existing on the internet because i judge myself a bit too much and worry about looking like i try too hard and end up looking ""cringe"" (i know this is stupid because i never ever feel this way about anyone on the internet and i know that if i want to succeed i need to overcome that anxiety of being an online person). i know for a fact that i'm an interesting person when i'm around people i'm comfortable with, but when it comes to showing this outside of my comfort zone i just freeze out of fear of being judged.

 i also struggle *a lot* with posting and not getting numbers, specially after i've been doing it consistently for a few weeks and still no results. i tend to get a struck of motivation to grow slow and steady (which i know is the best) for a few days and fall back into weeks of inactivity due to thinking that maybe i'm doing something wrong and somehow it's my fault that i'm not getting more numbers. i tend to compare myself to other alternative girls on tiktok and twitter *a lot*.  the thought that going viral is the only way to get up there constantly creeps up in my head and drains me of all motivation, but i honestly know deep down that growing slowly is a lot more common than the people who blow off out of nowhere make it seem. i love checking pages for people who have a similar look and niche to mine to look at what they are doing right, looking at how much they post and most of the time they really are bring consistent and it helps me get a mental check that this *is* what gets you up there.

when it comes to content, i do mostly topless on feed and full nude on ppv. i end up creating generic content with generic looks because i fear being genuine even though i know that being unique is key to this job (although i do have an alternative look from having piercings and tattoos, which probably helps). i want to focus on reddit, tiktok and twitter (i'd like to grow organically on twitter though), not necessarily all at once. 

my main goals right now are:

-creating content in bulk for one or two months (i've done this before so i know it works out for me, but i stuggle with believing i will actually take good pics even though i tend to be satisfied with what i make. i haven't created content in over a year so the thought of doing it again and the pics coming out crappy is a real fear rn)

-posting at least 20 times daily on reddit (i have a content plan so it doesn't get spammy but i have such a hard time thinking of captions and finding subs to post because of the requirements. i really need to verify in some subs and grow my account so i can post in more subs too)

-being more active on tiktok (goal is 1-2 posts a day)

i love studying strategies to promote and sell on onlyfans and i'm one of these people who plan waaay too much but never put things into practice because there is always something to improve on my plan. i know pretty well that this is self sabotaging, though! i know from seeing other girls' paths that we learn much more with practice than in theory only because we can't possibly know what works for us and what doesn't based solely on other people's experiences. everyone has their own path. and i'm so tired of fantasizing of what will be my path when i'm not actually running after it. i've wanted to do this for 4 years and i'm constantly studying strategies but somehow i can never stick to my plans because my stupid brain wants instant gratification for getting things done üò≠ i suck at being disciplined with of because it's something i want to work out so bad and not seeing it succeed at first is really scary i guess

anyways that's a huge post/rant i'm sorry hahah
but if you identify somehow with my experience and niche and want to text each other daily to help each other be accountable for promoting on reddit/tiktok and making content as well as sharing our struggles and achievements with each other that would be lovely! it would be best if we are on similar niches as well because i believe we could identify with each other a little more regarding our experiences, goals, struggles, etc (this is not about body type at all! i mean this more towards the alternative/emo/goth thing btw!!)

i'd also like to thank everyone who takes their time daily to post tips and answer questions on here. i've learned sooo much with you all and this is the first online community i've actually been a part of for years (even though i mostly just watch and don't really post) and it's super comforting to see there are so many people willing to help each other! <3",ikyqpvy,I was looking for something like this!

so anyways!! my name is emi and i'm in the alternative/goth/emo/whatever you wanna call it niche (this is my of acc so you can find some pics on my profile!). i'm vegan and i'd love to branch out to making recipe tiktoks, twitch lives and even youtube videos (that would be more like a hobby i've always wanted to do but i've figured it could be great promo as well). i'm into somewhat ""alternative"" music so i believe this could also be a great niche to go for. 
i love using my personal twitter and i feel like i could fit the ""e-girl"" niche but i have a *really* hard time being consistent, interacting and simply existing on the internet because i judge myself a bit too much and worry about looking like i try too hard and end up looking ""cringe"" (i know this is stupid because i never ever feel this way about anyone on the internet and i know that if i want to succeed i need to overcome that anxiety of being an online person). i know for a fact that i'm an interesting person when i'm around people i'm comfortable with, but when it comes to showing this outside of my comfort zone i just freeze out of fear of being judged.

 i also struggle *a lot* with posting and not getting numbers, specially after i've been doing it consistently for a few weeks and still no results. i tend to get a struck of motivation to grow slow and steady (which i know is the best) for a few days and fall back into weeks of inactivity due to thinking that maybe i'm doing something wrong and somehow it's my fault that i'm not getting more numbers. i tend to compare myself to other alternative girls on tiktok and twitter *a lot*.  the thought that going viral is the only way to get up there constantly creeps up in my head and drains me of all motivation, but i honestly know deep down that growing slowly is a lot more common than the people who blow off out of nowhere make it seem. i love checking pages for people who have a similar look and niche to mine to look at what they are doing right, looking at how much they post and most of the time they really are bring consistent and it helps me get a mental check that this *is* what gets you up there.

when it comes to content, i do mostly topless on feed and full nude on ppv. i end up creating generic content with generic looks because i fear being genuine even though i know that being unique is key to this job (although i do have an alternative look from having piercings and tattoos, which probably helps). i want to focus on reddit, tiktok and twitter (i'd like to grow organically on twitter though), not necessarily all at once. 

my main goals right now are:

-creating content in bulk for one or two months (i've done this before so i know it works out for me, but i stuggle with believing i will actually take good pics even though i tend to be satisfied with what i make. i haven't created content in over a year so the thought of doing it again and the pics coming out crappy is a real fear rn)

-posting at least 20 times daily on reddit (i have a content plan so it doesn't get spammy but i have such a hard time thinking of captions and finding subs to post because of the requirements. i really need to verify in some subs and grow my account so i can post in more subs too)

-being more active on tiktok (goal is 1-2 posts a day)

i love studying strategies to promote and sell on onlyfans and i'm one of these people who plan waaay too much but never put things into practice because there is always something to improve on my plan. i know pretty well that this is self sabotaging, though! i know from seeing other girls' paths that we learn much more with practice than in theory only because we can't possibly know what works for us and what doesn't based solely on other people's experiences. everyone has their own path. and i'm so tired of fantasizing of what will be my path when i'm not actually running after it. i've wanted to do this for 4 years and i'm constantly studying strategies but somehow i can never stick to my plans because my stupid brain wants instant gratification for getting things done üò≠ i suck at being disciplined with of because it's something i want to work out so bad and not seeing it succeed at first is really scary i guess

anyways that's a huge post/rant i'm sorry hahah
but if you identify somehow with my experience and niche and want to text each other daily to help each other be accountable for promoting on reddit/tiktok and making content as well as sharing our struggles and achievements with each other that would be lovely! it would be best if we are on similar niches as well because i believe we could identify with each other a little more regarding our experiences, goals, struggles, etc (this is not about body type at all! i mean this more towards the alternative/emo/goth thing btw!!)

so anyways!! my name is emi and i'm in the alternative/goth/emo/whatever you wanna call it niche (this is my of acc so you can find some pics on my profile!). i'm vegan and i'd love to branch out to making recipe tiktoks, twitch lives and even youtube videos (that would be more like a hobby i've always wanted to do but i've figured it could be great promo as well). i'm into somewhat ""alternative"" music so i believe this could also be a great niche to go for. 
i love using my personal twitter and i feel like i could fit the ""e-girl"" niche but i have a *really* hard time being consistent, interacting and simply existing on the internet because i judge myself a bit too much and worry about looking like i try too hard and end up looking ""cringe"" (i know this is stupid because i never ever feel this way about anyone on the internet and i know that if i want to succeed i need to overcome that anxiety of being an online person). i know for a fact that i'm an interesting person when i'm around people i'm comfortable with, but when it comes to showing this outside of my comfort zone i just freeze out of fear of being judged.

 i also struggle *a lot* with posting and not getting numbers, specially after i've been doing it consistently for a few weeks and still no results. i tend to get a struck of motivation to grow slow and steady (which i know is the best) for a few days and fall back into weeks of inactivity due to thinking that maybe i'm doing something wrong and somehow it's my fault that i'm not getting more numbers. i tend to compare myself to other alternative girls on tiktok and twitter *a lot*.  the thought that going viral is the only way to get up there constantly creeps up in my head and drains me of all motivation, but i honestly know deep down that growing slowly is a lot more common than the people who blow off out of nowhere make it seem. i love checking pages for people who have a similar look and niche to mine to look at what they are doing right, looking at how much they post and most of the time they really are bring consistent and it helps me get a mental check that this *is* what gets you up there.

when it comes to content, i do mostly topless on feed and full nude on ppv. i end up creating generic content with generic looks because i fear being genuine even though i know that being unique is key to this job (although i do have an alternative look from having piercings and tattoos, which probably helps). i want to focus on reddit, tiktok and twitter (i'd like to grow organically on twitter though), not necessarily all at once. 

my main goals right now are:

-creating content in bulk for one or two months (i've done this before so i know it works out for me, but i stuggle with believing i will actually take good pics even though i tend to be satisfied with what i make. i haven't created content in over a year so the thought of doing it again and the pics coming out crappy is a real fear rn)

-posting at least 20 times daily on reddit (i have a content plan so it doesn't get spammy but i have such a hard time thinking of captions and finding subs to post because of the requirements. i really need to verify in some subs and grow my account so i can post in more subs too)

-being more active on tiktok (goal is 1-2 posts a day)

i love studying strategies to promote and sell on onlyfans and i'm one of these people who plan waaay too much but never put things into practice because there is always something to improve on my plan. i know pretty well that this is self sabotaging, though! i know from seeing other girls' paths that we learn much more with practice than in theory only because we can't possibly know what works for us and what doesn't based solely on other people's experiences. everyone has their own path. and i'm so tired of fantasizing of what will be my path when i'm not actually running after it. i've wanted to do this for 4 years and i'm constantly studying strategies but somehow i can never stick to my plans because my stupid brain wants instant gratification for getting things done üò≠ i suck at being disciplined with of because it's something i want to work out so bad and not seeing it succeed at first is really scary i guess

anyways that's a huge post/rant i'm sorry hahah
but if you identify somehow with my experience and niche and want to text each other daily to help each other be accountable for promoting on reddit/tiktok and making content as well as sharing our struggles and achievements with each other that would be lovely! it would be best if we are on similar niches as well because i believe we could identify with each other a little more regarding our experiences, goals, struggles, etc (this is not about body type at all! i mean this more towards the alternative/emo/goth thing btw!!)

hi everyone! i'm looking for an accountability buddy that is interested in texting about our progress daily, talking about what we did that day in regards to posting, creating content, promoting, sharing things we learn along the way and tips. overall i'd love to have someone to share their experience and to whom i can share mine as well. 

although this can also mean a new sw friend, i want this to be most of all a way of creating accountability and motivation for both of us, so it would be best if you also struggle with being consistent or if you are doing great with that and want to help someone who struggles a lot! lol

i'm sharing a little about myself and my ups and downs with this job and if you feel like we have a similar experience please leave a comment so we can chat! i really feel like this could help both of us actually get things done so i'm willing to chat a little and find someone to click with.

so anyways!! my name is emi and i'm in the alternative/goth/emo/whatever you wanna call it niche (this is my of acc so you can find some pics on my profile!). i'm vegan and i'd love to branch out to making recipe tiktoks, twitch lives and even youtube videos (that would be more like a hobby i've always wanted to do but i've figured it could be great promo as well). i'm into somewhat ""alternative"" music so i believe this could also be a great niche to go for. 
i love using my personal twitter and i feel like i could fit the ""e-girl"" niche but i have a *really* hard time being consistent, interacting and simply existing on the internet because i judge myself a bit too much and worry about looking like i try too hard and end up looking ""cringe"" (i know this is stupid because i never ever feel this way about anyone on the internet and i know that if i want to succeed i need to overcome that anxiety of being an online person). i know for a fact that i'm an interesting person when i'm around people i'm comfortable with, but when it comes to showing this outside of my comfort zone i just freeze out of fear of being judged.

 i also struggle *a lot* with posting and not getting numbers, specially after i've been doing it consistently for a few weeks and still no results. i tend to get a struck of motivation to grow slow and steady (which i know is the best) for a few days and fall back into weeks of inactivity due to thinking that maybe i'm doing something wrong and somehow it's my fault that i'm not getting more numbers. i tend to compare myself to other alternative girls on tiktok and twitter *a lot*.  the thought that going viral is the only way to get up there constantly creeps up in my head and drains me of all motivation, but i honestly know deep down that growing slowly is a lot more common than the people who blow off out of nowhere make it seem. i love checking pages for people who have a similar look and niche to mine to look at what they are doing right, looking at how much they post and most of the time they really are bring consistent and it helps me get a mental check that this *is* what gets you up there.

when it comes to content, i do mostly topless on feed and full nude on ppv. i end up creating generic content with generic looks because i fear being genuine even though i know that being unique is key to this job (although i do have an alternative look from having piercings and tattoos, which probably helps). i want to focus on reddit, tiktok and twitter (i'd like to grow organically on twitter though), not necessarily all at once. 

my main goals right now are:

-creating content in bulk for one or two months (i've done this before so i know it works out for me, but i stuggle with believing i will actually take good pics even though i tend to be satisfied with what i make. i haven't created content in over a year so the thought of doing it again and the pics coming out crappy is a real fear rn)

-posting at least 20 times daily on reddit (i have a content plan so it doesn't get spammy but i have such a hard time thinking of captions and finding subs to post because of the requirements. i really need to verify in some subs and grow my account so i can post in more subs too)

-being more active on tiktok (goal is 1-2 posts a day)

i love studying strategies to promote and sell on onlyfans and i'm one of these people who plan waaay too much but never put things into practice because there is always something to improve on my plan. i know pretty well that this is self sabotaging, though! i know from seeing other girls' paths that we learn much more with practice than in theory only because we can't possibly know what works for us and what doesn't based solely on other people's experiences. everyone has their own path. and i'm so tired of fantasizing of what will be my path when i'm not actually running after it. i've wanted to do this for 4 years and i'm constantly studying strategies but somehow i can never stick to my plans because my stupid brain wants instant gratification for getting things done üò≠ i suck at being disciplined with of because it's something i want to work out so bad and not seeing it succeed at first is really scary i guess

anyways that's a huge post/rant i'm sorry hahah
but if you identify somehow with my experience and niche and want to text each other daily to help each other be accountable for promoting on reddit/tiktok and making content as well as sharing our struggles and achievements with each other that would be lovely! it would be best if we are on similar niches as well because i believe we could identify with each other a little more regarding our experiences, goals, struggles, etc (this is not about body type at all! i mean this more towards the alternative/emo/goth thing btw!!)

i'd also like to thank everyone who takes their time daily to post tips and answer questions on here. i've learned sooo much with you all and this is the first online community i've actually been a part of for years (even though i mostly just watch and don't really post) and it's super comforting to see there are so many people willing to help each other! <3<|eost|><|sor u/mmmolly_riot|>I‚Äôm gonna DM you as well but I think we have very similar styles!

If I don't have to shoot, I do TikTok lives, manage the content through my phone/PC, edit stuff, schedule, try to engage with subs,.. As I said this can really vary a lot! 

In the evenings I usually work at my vanilla job but if not I use to choose what to do based on the day! If I still feel motivated and maybe alone at home (so I easily get annoyed and need to do something) I can spend 1/2 more hours at the PC, but usually I spend this time with my bf!

I promote on Reddit 4-5x a week, sometimes less. So I normally do this right when I wake up around 6:45-7:15 am. I post on 10-20 subs, sometimes more if I feel like it.

If you‚Äôre not advertising your page as no PPV, then it‚Äôs safe to assume there is PPV. That sub was just being a dickhead. Personally, I try to respond respectfully to constructive criticism (ex: ‚Äúhey I think the lighting could be a little better next time. Have you tried doing ___?‚Äù) but the minute it turns into a custom request (such as your sub demanding a sex tape) that kindness goes out the window. Like, if they can offer a solution or tip to make something better, I‚Äôll listen. If their solution is ‚Äúgive me free shit‚Äù they can suck my nonexistent dick lol

However, the rationale I gave to my subs about potential b/g content being PPV only was basically that not everybody who is subscribed to me is interested in b/g content. So in an attempt to appease everyone, b/g content will be PPV.

Thankyouuüíó<|eost|><|sor u/bitchtits08|>These are all really good comments of advice. My approach is a little different, and bitch is literally in my name, so take it with a grain of salt. 

‚ÄúI set my prices. I‚Äôm glad you love seeing me, but you get what you get from me at the price you pay. Pornhub is free. I am not. I‚Äôm not going to discuss it further, my price for a 10 minute video is $X. I‚Äôm not THAT hard up for your money for you to disrespect me into assuming you‚Äôll get it for free.‚Äù

I know a lot of creators DO rely on this for their income, but when you‚Äôre making posts like this, questioning your worth, letting it affect your mental health, the money this sub (or those subs) are paying you IS NOT WORTH IT. This isn‚Äôt to shame you, it‚Äôs a friendly reminder that you ARE YOUR OWN BOSS. THIS IS YOUR BUSINESS. Don‚Äôt be devalued because you want to keep a sub who is not valuing the service you offer.<|eor|><|soopr u/Opening-Midnight-468|>Thankyou smüíóI really needed this.I had let the subs kinda ‚Äòbully‚Äô me and had forgotten that one of the reasons I started OF was to do sth on my own terms and to set my own rules !

I‚Äôve deleted guys I truly actually liked off of my Snapchat - the rule is, you stay here as long as you‚Äôre subscribed to me. I have CashApp and Venmo if they don‚Äôt want to do OnlyFans. I truly enjoyed the conversations I had with these guys, but at the end of the day, you know my price and I know my worth. I come across as cocky, but it‚Äôs true.

I just feel stuck. 

I've read a lot of advice here and taken in a lot of info from here and youtube. A lot of the advice is conflicting, like some say raise your price as people like to pay more and you can charge a premium...and I am all for that. I actually believe that's true.  It's creates value and weeds out the broke dudes

But at the same time I get the argument that cheaper is better because more people can afford it and you get more people opting in. 

My sub price is $15.99. I have a little anxiety around this but I am going to stick it out to see what will happen. Last time I raised my price it ended it up well for me (from $6.99 to $9.99) and I got a different crowd of buyers. Basically my subscribers were replaced, the old ones dropped off and new ones came in. But I still ended up around 10 subs üò©

I changed to that price because I saw people on my Fansly pay that lol I guess the transition stage (going from one price to a higher one) gives me a lot of anxiety.  I have subs   *say* they will stay, but who really knows if they will. 

When I started about a year ago I did it as a hobby but now I am interested in growing my account as a business. I see a lot of creators have hundreds of subs at a decent price (like $10+) and some of ya'll are complaining that you are stuck there lol I would love to have that problem. 

Even 10+ subs are amazing to me as I have never been able to budge past say 15 at my highest lol 

So I wanna know, BBWs, chubby girls, what's the secret? 

How often do you post if you use reddit? 

How much time do you spend every day promoting? (Is it more of a hobby or a part time job or full time job?)

How long did it take you to get where you are now?

How long did it take you to get where you are now? 

I am REALLY interested to hear more controversial/different methods that don't come up on this sub very often as well, I see a lot of the same advice here and I just don't think they always work for everyone. Feel free to DM me if you don't wanna share here, I know downvotes can be harsh lol",ikvcubt,"Hey! I‚Äôm a plus size creator and honestly is hard, I feel  most successful creators are always ‚Äústandard‚Äù bodies and Reddit is fat phobic but you can get some more subscribers. 
I started onlyfans in 2018 and had like 20 subscribers for the first two years as I just promoted on instagram (and didn‚Äôt have many followers) and then i started Reddit which helped me a lot !! And also went from a 15$ subscription to 10$ 

So, if is very slow and quiet I do sales. For the weekend and sometimes for a whole week when is really bad. I post on niche subreddits like Bbw, chubby, bbwmilf , fatwomenlove, big boobs and just subreddit relevant to my body, i usually follow other creators with my body type and lurk where they post as I feel there aren‚Äôt many subs for us bigger girls .  I don‚Äôt spam the same gif/photo in every sub, I post 2-3 times  a day, in about 10 subs, really depends sometimes more sometimes less. And also I delete my post that didn‚Äôt go after a few hours. The ones that do good I kept them a few days in my feed. I just don‚Äôt want my profile to be full of free stuff. I post lingerie and topless. 

And that‚Äôs what works for me. I do still post on instagram but I don‚Äôt have many followers and most don‚Äôt subscribe. I use twitter too but is not good for me. I used to promote on Snapchat and sometimes is good sometimes is bad, most people just want free stuff there but maybe give it a go if you have time. And TikTok apparently is good too I‚Äôm not comfortable with it yet so didn‚Äôt try it. If you have questions you can message me is always good to talk to someone like us as most people giving advice and talking about how they quickly got in the top 2% are usually skinny and I feel it doesn‚Äôt work the same haha ü•∞","<|soss r/onlyfansadvice|><|sot|>Stuck at around 10 subs, successful BBWs please help.<|eot|><|sost|>I have a lot of pride and asking for help and actually taking advice is kinda hard for me but here we go... 

I just feel stuck. 

I've read a lot of advice here and taken in a lot of info from here and youtube. A lot of the advice is conflicting, like some say raise your price as people like to pay more and you can charge a premium...and I am all for that. I actually believe that's true.  It's creates value and weeds out the broke dudes

But at the same time I get the argument that cheaper is better because more people can afford it and you get more people opting in. 

My sub price is $15.99. I have a little anxiety around this but I am going to stick it out to see what will happen. Last time I raised my price it ended it up well for me (from $6.99 to $9.99) and I got a different crowd of buyers. Basically my subscribers were replaced, the old ones dropped off and new ones came in. But I still ended up around 10 subs üò©

I changed to that price because I saw people on my Fansly pay that lol I guess the transition stage (going from one price to a higher one) gives me a lot of anxiety.  I have subs   *say* they will stay, but who really knows if they will. 

When I started about a year ago I did it as a hobby but now I am interested in growing my account as a business. I see a lot of creators have hundreds of subs at a decent price (like $10+) and some of ya'll are complaining that you are stuck there lol I would love to have that problem. 

Even 10+ subs are amazing to me as I have never been able to budge past say 15 at my highest lol

Basically my subscribers were replaced, the old ones dropped off and new ones came in. But I still ended up around 10 subs üò©

I changed to that price because I saw people on my Fansly pay that lol I guess the transition stage (going from one price to a higher one) gives me a lot of anxiety.  I have subs   *say* they will stay, but who really knows if they will. 

When I started about a year ago I did it as a hobby but now I am interested in growing my account as a business. I see a lot of creators have hundreds of subs at a decent price (like $10+) and some of ya'll are complaining that you are stuck there lol I would love to have that problem. 

Even 10+ subs are amazing to me as I have never been able to budge past say 15 at my highest lol 

So I wanna know, BBWs, chubby girls, what's the secret? 

How often do you post if you use reddit? 

How much time do you spend every day promoting? (Is it more of a hobby or a part time job or full time job?)

How long did it take you to get where you are now? 

I am REALLY interested to hear more controversial/different methods that don't come up on this sub very often as well, I see a lot of the same advice here and I just don't think they always work for everyone.

I started onlyfans in 2018 and had like 20 subscribers for the first two years as I just promoted on instagram (and didn‚Äôt have many followers) and then i started Reddit which helped me a lot !! And also went from a 15$ subscription to 10$ 

So, if is very slow and quiet I do sales. For the weekend and sometimes for a whole week when is really bad. I post on niche subreddits like Bbw, chubby, bbwmilf , fatwomenlove, big boobs and just subreddit relevant to my body, i usually follow other creators with my body type and lurk where they post as I feel there aren‚Äôt many subs for us bigger girls .  I don‚Äôt spam the same gif/photo in every sub, I post 2-3 times  a day, in about 10 subs, really depends sometimes more sometimes less. And also I delete my post that didn‚Äôt go after a few hours. The ones that do good I kept them a few days in my feed. I just don‚Äôt want my profile to be full of free stuff. I post lingerie and topless.

I have been on Reddit and onlyfans for a year now and I‚Äôve had pretty consistent growth since the beginning both on Reddit and OF. I wouldn‚Äôt say there is a secret to success or that any one of us is better than the other, in fact I think success has a lot to do with many many different things! consistently, research(constant), switching things up, listening to and appreciating your followers (for me whether they are paid or not they have all gotten me to where I am today.) knowing there will be slow days(many of them) and continuing to post, finding your niche, posting in the right subs etc! 

For me, I‚Äôm at about 200 paid fans right now and I sit at about 8% my lowest was 7.2% , my sub price is 9.99$ but I‚Äôve had a sale for the last month that‚Äôs done extremely well for me (I didn‚Äôt do sales often before this at all) 

A huge turning point for me and when I started gaining subs is when I started showing all of my extra skin on my tummy a bunch(I‚Äôm a Bbw that has lost a lot of weight but still have very much to love on lol) I started taking my weightloss tummy to my advantage and showing off all my worst angles which then gained me a super niche following and subs it‚Äôs made a huge difference for me!

My sub price is $15.99. I have a little anxiety around this but I am going to stick it out to see what will happen. Last time I raised my price it ended it up well for me (from $6.99 to $9.99) and I got a different crowd of buyers. Basically my subscribers were replaced, the old ones dropped off and new ones came in. But I still ended up around 10 subs üò©

I changed to that price because I saw people on my Fansly pay that lol I guess the transition stage (going from one price to a higher one) gives me a lot of anxiety.  I have subs   *say* they will stay, but who really knows if they will. 

When I started about a year ago I did it as a hobby but now I am interested in growing my account as a business. I see a lot of creators have hundreds of subs at a decent price (like $10+) and some of ya'll are complaining that you are stuck there lol I would love to have that problem. 

Even 10+ subs are amazing to me as I have never been able to budge past say 15 at my highest lol 

So I wanna know, BBWs, chubby girls, what's the secret? 

How often do you post if you use reddit? 

How much time do you spend every day promoting? (Is it more of a hobby or a part time job or full time job?)

How long did it take you to get where you are now? 

I am REALLY interested to hear more controversial/different methods that don't come up on this sub very often as well, I see a lot of the same advice here and I just don't think they always work for everyone. Feel free to DM me if you don't wanna share here, I know downvotes can be harsh lol<|eost|><|sor u/funlovingbbw|>Hi love! I have been on Reddit and onlyfans for a year now and I‚Äôve had pretty consistent growth since the beginning both on Reddit and OF. I wouldn‚Äôt say there is a secret to success or that any one of us is better than the other, in fact I think success has a lot to do with many many different things! consistently, research(constant), switching things up, listening to and appreciating your followers (for me whether they are paid or not they have all gotten me to where I am today.) knowing there will be slow days(many of them) and continuing to post, finding your niche, posting in the right subs etc! 

For me, I‚Äôm at about 200 paid fans right now and I sit at about 8% my lowest was 7.2% , my sub price is 9.99$ but I‚Äôve had a sale for the last month that‚Äôs done extremely well for me (I didn‚Äôt do sales often before this at all) 

A huge turning point for me and when I started gaining subs is when I started showing all of my extra skin on my tummy a bunch(I‚Äôm a Bbw that has lost a lot of weight but still have very much to love on lol) I started taking my weightloss tummy to my advantage and showing off all my worst angles which then gained me a super niche following and subs it‚Äôs made a huge difference for me! But belly play in general for bbws is a huge thing and not everyone does it but it does really well for me!

Feel free to DM me if you don't wanna share here, I know downvotes can be harsh lol<|eost|><|sor u/MarionberryAway9284|>Hey! I‚Äôm a plus size creator and honestly is hard, I feel  most successful creators are always ‚Äústandard‚Äù bodies and Reddit is fat phobic but you can get some more subscribers. 
I started onlyfans in 2018 and had like 20 subscribers for the first two years as I just promoted on instagram (and didn‚Äôt have many followers) and then i started Reddit which helped me a lot !! And also went from a 15$ subscription to 10$ 

So, if is very slow and quiet I do sales. For the weekend and sometimes for a whole week when is really bad. I post on niche subreddits like Bbw, chubby, bbwmilf , fatwomenlove, big boobs and just subreddit relevant to my body, i usually follow other creators with my body type and lurk where they post as I feel there aren‚Äôt many subs for us bigger girls .  I don‚Äôt spam the same gif/photo in every sub, I post 2-3 times  a day, in about 10 subs, really depends sometimes more sometimes less. And also I delete my post that didn‚Äôt go after a few hours. The ones that do good I kept them a few days in my feed. I just don‚Äôt want my profile to be full of free stuff. I post lingerie and topless. 

And that‚Äôs what works for me. I do still post on instagram but I don‚Äôt have many followers and most don‚Äôt subscribe. I use twitter too but is not good for me. I used to promote on Snapchat and sometimes is good sometimes is bad, most people just want free stuff there but maybe give it a go if you have time. And TikTok apparently is good too I‚Äôm not comfortable with it yet so didn‚Äôt try it. If you have questions you can message me is always good to talk to someone like us as most people giving advice and talking about how they quickly got in the top 2% are usually skinny and I feel it doesn‚Äôt work the same haha ü•∞<|eor|><|soopr u/Effective_Jellyfish|>Do you mean you dropped your price?

Last time I raised my price it ended it up well for me (from $6.99 to $9.99) and I got a different crowd of buyers. Basically my subscribers were replaced, the old ones dropped off and new ones came in. But I still ended up around 10 subs üò©

I changed to that price because I saw people on my Fansly pay that lol I guess the transition stage (going from one price to a higher one) gives me a lot of anxiety.  I have subs   *say* they will stay, but who really knows if they will. 

When I started about a year ago I did it as a hobby but now I am interested in growing my account as a business. I see a lot of creators have hundreds of subs at a decent price (like $10+) and some of ya'll are complaining that you are stuck there lol I would love to have that problem. 

Even 10+ subs are amazing to me as I have never been able to budge past say 15 at my highest lol 

So I wanna know, BBWs, chubby girls, what's the secret? 

How often do you post if you use reddit? 

How much time do you spend every day promoting? (Is it more of a hobby or a part time job or full time job?)

How long did it take you to get where you are now? 

I am REALLY interested to hear more controversial/different methods that don't come up on this sub very often as well, I see a lot of the same advice here and I just don't think they always work for everyone. Feel free to DM me if you don't wanna share here, I know downvotes can be harsh lol<|eost|><|sor u/massivemegan|>üëãüèª I started with 0 following and sit around 1% on OF - most of my subs are from Reddit - I'm happy to give you some advice<|eor|><|soopr u/Effective_Jellyfish|>Omg!

I just feel stuck. 

I've read a lot of advice here and taken in a lot of info from here and youtube. A lot of the advice is conflicting, like some say raise your price as people like to pay more and you can charge a premium...and I am all for that. I actually believe that's true.  It's creates value and weeds out the broke dudes

I‚Äôm a plus size creator and honestly is hard, I feel  most successful creators are always ‚Äústandard‚Äù bodies and Reddit is fat phobic but you can get some more subscribers. 
I started onlyfans in 2018 and had like 20 subscribers for the first two years as I just promoted on instagram (and didn‚Äôt have many followers) and then i started Reddit which helped me a lot !! And also went from a 15$ subscription to 10$ 

So, if is very slow and quiet I do sales. For the weekend and sometimes for a whole week when is really bad. I post on niche subreddits like Bbw, chubby, bbwmilf , fatwomenlove, big boobs and just subreddit relevant to my body, i usually follow other creators with my body type and lurk where they post as I feel there aren‚Äôt many subs for us bigger girls .  I don‚Äôt spam the same gif/photo in every sub, I post 2-3 times  a day, in about 10 subs, really depends sometimes more sometimes less. And also I delete my post that didn‚Äôt go after a few hours. The ones that do good I kept them a few days in my feed. I just don‚Äôt want my profile to be full of free stuff. I post lingerie and topless. 

And that‚Äôs what works for me. I do still post on instagram but I don‚Äôt have many followers and most don‚Äôt subscribe. I use twitter too but is not good for me. I used to promote on Snapchat and sometimes is good sometimes is bad, most people just want free stuff there but maybe give it a go if you have time. And TikTok apparently is good too I‚Äôm not comfortable with it yet so didn‚Äôt try it. If you have questions you can message me is always good to talk to someone like us as most people giving advice and talking about how they quickly got in the top 2% are usually skinny and I feel it doesn‚Äôt work the same haha ü•∞<|eor|><|soopr u/Effective_Jellyfish|>Do you mean you dropped your price? 
Thank you for replying!

I‚Äôve seen far too many posts basically asking for legal and health advice. **Most of us** are not qualified to give that type of advice and there are already subreddits that you can ask those types of questions on.

If you truly feel as though your safety is at risk, contact your local authorities. If you‚Äôre having health issues with your coochie (or any other body part) please contact a doctor. The telehealth industry is booming and although I understand that without insurance, contacting a provider can be costly but so can receiving inaccurate information as it can seriously affect your health. 

I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of people active in this subreddit who are law enforcement, lawyers, and doctors. However, even the subreddits for stuff like this state that they are not adequate substitutions for contacting a doctor, lawyer, law enforcement, etc. 

This post isn‚Äôt meant to be shade to another creator whose thread I recently commented on.

I average around Top 80 on ManyVids. In my heyday, I was Top 30, and now I hover around 150 to 170 since I'm taking a several-week break to focus on school. Conversely, I'm definitely not as active or ""high-ranking"" on Pornhub, but it still accounts for a considerable amount of traffic compared to ManyVids (11% vs 17%) which I find to be very interesting. However, as others have mentioned, MV is a phenomenal source of passive income. The website is very broken right now from the recent update though.

The minimum upload time on MV is 1 minute. I post \~20-minute videos, but I am primarily a clip artist. Three- or five-minute clips sell just as well if you price them appropriately. You can geoblock states.

If you are a subscription-focused creator (i.e. OF, Fansly), I would actually recommend Pornhub over ManyVids for driving traffic. The userbase is very, very different. Virtually all of my subscription-focused SW friends and mutuals by far use Pornhub to drive traffic and rarely (if ever) touch Manyvids.","<|soss r/onlyfansadvice|><|sot|>Pornhub vs Manyvids<|eot|><|sost|>I have found allot of info on both thru searching here but I'm wondering people's experiences with each & if they prefer one over the other & why?

The minimum upload time on MV is 1 minute. I post \~20-minute videos, but I am primarily a clip artist. Three- or five-minute clips sell just as well if you price them appropriately. You can geoblock states.

If you are a subscription-focused creator (i.e. OF, Fansly), I would actually recommend Pornhub over ManyVids for driving traffic. The userbase is very, very different. Virtually all of my subscription-focused SW friends and mutuals by far use Pornhub to drive traffic and rarely (if ever) touch Manyvids.<|eor|><|endoftext|>",Boba_Bitchh

Aside from the slow processing rate, I love ManyVids. It takes a bit to figure out how to work the app, but once you got it it‚Äôs kind of fun IMO üòÖ 

I haven‚Äôt done PornHub, but I definitely recommend ManyVids if you want that little extra income - since the videos are always there. Plus they have a MV membership for your buyers and your videos can also get rated. And it‚Äôs fetish and kink friendly. If you go post a video with a partner or anyone, you just upload a consent form. It‚Äôs only to protect yourself if anything were to happen, but it‚Äôs not required. Plus it‚Äôs really nice being able to see into specific niches.

It's even slower then uploading to OF.,ii9n7de,"I suspect it's an issue on your end.  Assuming you aren't having the issue on other platforms, it isn't a bandwidth issue. 

Most likely it's an encoding issue with how you (or your phone if you don't edit your videos) renders the video output.  You have to optimize videos files for delivery on the web.  On every platform, when you upload a video, they will take your video file and reprocess it, to fit the website's specifications.  If you're transmitting a file that hasn't been optimized, you're sending a ton of data that the platform needs to reformat.  In my experience, the process OF uses for this is a bit quicker than the one on MV... but it shouldn't be by much.

Also, are you uploading 4K video?  While the website supports it, there isn't really a benefit to offering it on there.  Based on the last numbers I've seen, less than 20% of web users actively stream at 4K  - the vast majority do not have the bandwidth to handle it -- and outside of a handful of power users, most will still buy Full HD content.  ManyVids does not include video resolution as a searchable, so you have no benefit from it to optimizing folks seeing your content on the platform.  By all means, continue to film in 4K - just output at Full HD (this is how I currently film).  At some point, 4K will be the standard so the option to upgrade the videos in the future will keep your back catalog relevant for longer.  

Second, are you using chrome to load the video to the website?  MV's build is optimized around chrome and using other browsers can cause issues.

If you're consistently having the issue, and none of these suggestions are helping, I strongly urge you  to open a ticket with their tech support.

My husband and I actually got contracted out by a content manager (Lustery) finding our videos on ManyVids.

i also love being able to have a place to put all my videos since I‚Äôm always clearing stuff on my phone for storage. I can‚Äôt afford like 3 phones so I gotta do what I gotta do. Anyway! Aside from the slow processing rate, I love ManyVids. It takes a bit to figure out how to work the app, but once you got it it‚Äôs kind of fun IMO üòÖ 

I haven‚Äôt done PornHub, but I definitely recommend ManyVids if you want that little extra income - since the videos are always there. Plus they have a MV membership for your buyers and your videos can also get rated. And it‚Äôs fetish and kink friendly. If you go post a video with a partner or anyone, you just upload a consent form. It‚Äôs only to protect yourself if anything were to happen, but it‚Äôs not required. Plus it‚Äôs really nice being able to see into specific niches. 

Hope this helps!<|eor|><|sor u/pinkpiratecow|>Hi! Jumping in on this. I do more tease / faux BJ/HJ/titty fuck with a dildo and also showing off my butt plug. I just don‚Äôt show insertion.

Most likely it's an encoding issue with how you (or your phone if you don't edit your videos) renders the video output.  You have to optimize videos files for delivery on the web.  On every platform, when you upload a video, they will take your video file and reprocess it, to fit the website's specifications.  If you're transmitting a file that hasn't been optimized, you're sending a ton of data that the platform needs to reformat.  In my experience, the process OF uses for this is a bit quicker than the one on MV... but it shouldn't be by much.

Also, are you uploading 4K video?  While the website supports it, there isn't really a benefit to offering it on there.  Based on the last numbers I've seen, less than 20% of web users actively stream at 4K  - the vast majority do not have the bandwidth to handle it -- and outside of a handful of power users, most will still buy Full HD content.  ManyVids does not include video resolution as a searchable, so you have no benefit from it to optimizing folks seeing your content on the platform.  By all means, continue to film in 4K - just output at Full HD (this is how I currently film).  At some point, 4K will be the standard so the option to upgrade the videos in the future will keep your back catalog relevant for longer.  

Second, are you using chrome to load the video to the website?  MV's build is optimized around chrome and using other browsers can cause issues.

If you're consistently having the issue, and none of these suggestions are helping, I strongly urge you  to open a ticket with their tech support.  They may be able to sort out what's happening with more info.",iia1y4j,"This is a great comment.

I've got a fairly large following (2k+ subs), so I'm wondering whether it makes sense given the many other things I could be doing for OF. It sounds like a lot of effort for potentially minimal return.

First of all, it seems like a lot of work: You have to take pictures of the garments you want to sell, put them up somewhere etc. If you sell them manually (via DMs) you have to spend time dealing with the customer. If you don't do it via OF, you have to figure out how to not get screwed on payment. Then you have to wear them, package them up, and take them to the post office within a short timeframe (so they don't lose their scent or whatever). Maintaining privacy/security adds even more faff (sending them from a non-local post office etc.).

From what I've seen, panties go for roughly $30-$80.

Say the panties cost $5, and the postage is $20 (I'm in Europe, most customers are in US). If you sell the panties for $60, you're only netting $35 profit. If you sell via OF, you've got to deduct a further 20% from that.

Doing all that work seems like it will take \*at least\* 30 mins to an hour, which is time I could be using to shoot pub, make PPVs, plan collabs etc. which would probably net me more than $25.

First of all, it seems like a lot of work: You have to take pictures of the garments you want to sell, put them up somewhere etc. If you sell them manually (via DMs) you have to spend time dealing with the customer. If you don't do it via OF, you have to figure out how to not get screwed on payment. Then you have to wear them, package them up, and take them to the post office within a short timeframe (so they don't lose their scent or whatever). Maintaining privacy/security adds even more faff (sending them from a non-local post office etc.).

From what I've seen, panties go for roughly $30-$80.

Say the panties cost $5, and the postage is $20 (I'm in Europe, most customers are in US). If you sell the panties for $60, you're only netting $35 profit. If you sell via OF, you've got to deduct a further 20% from that.

Doing all that work seems like it will take \*at least\* 30 mins to an hour, which is time I could be using to shoot pub, make PPVs, plan collabs etc. which would probably net me more than $25.

It also doesn't seem particularly scalable.

Is there an upside here that I'm missing? Am I overestimating the cost/time investment? Is it more scalable than I imagine?",ijhe5mu,"I'm in the US and my price starts at $50 for a worn pair of thongs. I can get them for a few bucks either online or a store like Walmart.

I make no secret I live in Vegas so I don't have to drive to the next city to mail them. 

It really doesn't pose a huge inconvenience for me at all this way. Stamps are .60 cents. After cost of product, shipping, and OF fees I usually net about $30ish dollars.

This is a business. You don't show up to open shop. Guess what? No customers. 

Have a theme...it's faceless and nudeless okay cool. What sets you apart? Are you a damsel in distress? Are you a married woman and hubby is gone? 

What fantasy are you fulfilling? So no face and no nudity but what else? Are you a character? Super hero? 

1. Set a schedule and stick to it. 
2. Have a theme, character or story
3. Decide on PPV or monthly fee (although some men|women will definitely not pay for no nudity & on top faceless) 

My thought is have a free Page and charge PPV for sets. A set for me is 3 photos 1 video (you can do whatever you want with your business) i charge PPV 

Since you are no nude and faceless your money will come from WHEN you do post a nude. So I'd doy regular faceless nudeless posts M, W, F and Sunday nude (charge as much as you want)

That will build the anticipation of what you look like and men will eventually crave to see more.

This is a business. You don't show up to open shop. Guess what? No customers. 

Have a theme...it's faceless and nudeless okay cool. What sets you apart? Are you a damsel in distress? Are you a married woman and hubby is gone? 

What fantasy are you fulfilling? So no face and no nudity but what else? Are you a character? Super hero? 

1. Set a schedule and stick to it. 
2. Have a theme, character or story
3. Decide on PPV or monthly fee (although some men|women will definitely not pay for no nudity & on top faceless) 

My thought is have a free Page and charge PPV for sets. A set for me is 3 photos 1 video (you can do whatever you want with your business) i charge PPV 

Since you are no nude and faceless your money will come from WHEN you do post a nude. So I'd doy regular faceless nudeless posts M, W, F and Sunday nude (charge as much as you want)

That will build the anticipation of what you look like and men will eventually crave to see more.

Hi - this is such a random note so I apologize in advance but I didn't think there would be much harm in me sending it so here we go...  I'm a recently divorced 37-year old who travels a ton and doesn't have a bunch of time for relationships at this point in my life. I run a tech company and am white, 6'1, relatively fit from playing a lot of sports (surfing, tennis, basketball, etc.), have olive skin, brown hair and brown eyes. I'm new to Reddit and randomly (well - maybe not so randomly) came across your profile and love your posts. While I'm sure you get a lot of these types of messages, I'd love to chat a bit and see if you'd be up for some kind of arrangement where we could meet up in exchange for me supplying you with whatever you would need.  I'm being 100% honest when I say that I've never done this before but I really like your posts and figured I might as well try! Totally get if you're not interested and obviously feel free to ignore.  Hope to hear from you<|eost|><|sor u/mascara_and_coffee|>Gotta love the fake candor!<|eor|><|endoftext|>",mascara_and_coffee

I‚Äôve been on Twitter for just about 2 weeks or so and have been steadily gaining without retweet groups. I really don‚Äôt think I want to go that route. Most of the content I see my on my feed is content I do not want to be associated with and how spammy it looks on my own Twitter. I‚Äôve gone to creator‚Äôs pages to see what they look like and literally given up after scrolling through their retweets. And what‚Äôs the point of gaining only SW followers? It‚Äôs not just me right? 

I‚Äôm showing my personality and trying to treat it as a photo blog basically. I‚Äôm looking for more engagement accounts. Ones that post everyday ‚Äúthong Thursday‚Äôs‚Äù or whatever. Is there an easy way to find these? 

Bonus question: what is the average conversion rate like? I‚Äôm not sure if anyone recent has come from Twitter.

Thanks y‚Äôall! üíï<|eost|><|sor u/SorenLuka|>This is tough for me.

Ultimately I decided not to do them just because I live with my family and it‚Äôs hard to schedule them. I only did one session for a very generous sub who got me a lot of gifts and gave me $100 for a 30 minute session where we just mostly talked while I showered. I used Snapchat for that but I‚Äôve also seen some have used discord. Ultimately it‚Äôs up to you and what you‚Äôre comfortable with pricing because there are girls who love doing it and girls who hate doing it. I‚Äôve seen everything from $2 per minute to $100 per minute. I think the most common price I saw was $10 or $15 per minute with a minute minimum usually 10 minutes. I‚Äôve also seen some who do extra things like for kinks it‚Äôs $15 per minute instead of their usual $10 per minute or I‚Äôve seen where they charge extra to use a toy or wear something specific but those were usually just flat fees instead of added onto the per minute price. I hope this helps :),"<|soss r/onlyfansadvice|><|sot|>Curious about cam sessions<|eot|><|sost|>Hi! First post here, hope you‚Äôre all succeeding! Keep pushing them goals ü§ç

I'm sorry for always coming here with my problems but it's the safest place I know that I can actually vent and get some advice since I don't have any friends that do this kind of work like me.

Recently I had to give up promoting on reddit because I was getting harassed by the same 2 people I would block them and they would create new accounts so I didn't feel safe posting here. So I've mainly been promoting my OF on Instagram, twitter (I post everyday) and  tiktok (very recent and I can't seen to get on the US fyp so it's not working very well) but no new subs. I've been sitting on 5 subs for 2 months now and to be honest I need more, life has been difficult and money too and I had started OF to help bring extra money to pay for the bills and medication. I now very well that this is not an easy way to make money and growth takes time but I just feel like maybe I'm doing something wrong?! My sub price is 12$ with PPV twice a month and lewd to nude on wall, I'm also a solo creator and a cosplayer so I try to use that as my niche and make costumes like maid, school uniform and cute things. 

I'm seriously even starting to think if I should come back to reddit even if I'm still very uneasy with it, or to be honest maybe my content or bio aren't good enough?! I don't want to lose hope in myself because I love creating my content but sometimes it just gets to me.

I've also been reading everything in this subreddit and taking notes and doing what I can with them, everyone has posted so many good things so any piece of extra advice would be very welcome.

Thank you in advance üíú",ilrl217,"Hi Hun! First of all, I want to send you all my good vibes as I totally feel you! 

And now, let me try write down a few thoughts about what you said! 

First of all, if you can't see a way to avoid those people harassing you and you can't deal with this in a safe way for you, I honestly think giving up here was the best thing you should do for you even if it's ridiculous and sad to think you aren't able to do your job 'cause stupid people like to bully on internet üòî 

I've started two years ago with OF but only a few months with promoting here! First (and actually too tho) I was using mainly Instagram, Twitter and Telegram and there's where I first started to grow a fan base. With this I mean Reddit isn't mandatory to get your subscribers! 

Adding TikTok greatly increased my gains, both with vids and going live! Dealing with bans and haters isn't easy but if you find your way it's a great social to get a very high conversion rate in subscribers! This is all about patience, consistency and not taking too serious bans and losing accounts! 

A VPN will def help you the US people! Search in this subreddit and you'll find all you need to set it up correctly! Personally, I'm in Europe, using an Android with NordVPN (my phone is setted up from the first start as it's located in US and all the locations setting are always turned off) and it works great!

I'm sorry for always coming here with my problems but it's the safest place I know that I can actually vent and get some advice since I don't have any friends that do this kind of work like me.

Recently I had to give up promoting on reddit because I was getting harassed by the same 2 people I would block them and they would create new accounts so I didn't feel safe posting here. So I've mainly been promoting my OF on Instagram, twitter (I post everyday) and  tiktok (very recent and I can't seen to get on the US fyp so it's not working very well) but no new subs. I've been sitting on 5 subs for 2 months now and to be honest I need more, life has been difficult and money too and I had started OF to help bring extra money to pay for the bills and medication. I now very well that this is not an easy way to make money and growth takes time but I just feel like maybe I'm doing something wrong?! My sub price is 12$ with PPV twice a month and lewd to nude on wall, I'm also a solo creator and a cosplayer so I try to use that as my niche and make costumes like maid, school uniform and cute things. 

I'm seriously even starting to think if I should come back to reddit even if I'm still very uneasy with it, or to be honest maybe my content or bio aren't good enough?! I don't want to lose hope in myself because I love creating my content but sometimes it just gets to me.

I've also been reading everything in this subreddit and taking notes and doing what I can with them, everyone has posted so many good things so any piece of extra advice would be very welcome.

I would suggest you add something to your rules stating similar to ""I have the right to refuse any request for customs. Do NOT send payment until we have discussed, and agreed upon, what the custom will be and its price. Any tips/money sent BEFORE we make a final agreement will be just a tip, will NOT be applied to the price of the custom, and will NOT be refunded"".

I also have a statement in my rules that ""Any tip sent without a note in regards to what it is for will be considered just a tip, will NOT be applied to any services/tip menu selections, and will NOT be refunded.""

I also agree with what many have said. With him wanting you to write his name on your body, and the gist of his requests...sounds like they want it to be able to pretend you be you else where. I wouldn't do it.

this pricing is correct but it sounds... weird? i've heard about writing things on yourself being a scam and i've never been asked to before. not only that, but it's pretty rude to demand something like that in a 24h period when i haven't even confirmed if i can do it. my wait time is longer than 24h normally anyway.

i'm just stuck because i am VERY bad at saying no. i always have been. it makes me feel really guilty?? i'm really just asking either what you would do if you got/have had a message like this or for some moral support.

edit: i do want to say that i've refused a few things before, but since he's already sent a tip and has expectations it's a bit harder for me to wrap my head around. also i realize it says ""let me know if it's possible,"" but then proceeds to tip before confirmation. it just has me thinking that was very passive and that this person isn't expecting me to say no at all<|eost|><|sor u/GoddessLeeLu|>I do NOT make customs, and this is part of the reason why. I do take suggestions, and if it is an idea I end up liking and using...I either give them that set free/with discount (depending on how I price it).

I would suggest you add something to your rules stating similar to ""I have the right to refuse any request for customs. Do NOT send payment until we have discussed, and agreed upon, what the custom will be and its price. Any tips/money sent BEFORE we make a final agreement will be just a tip, will NOT be applied to the price of the custom, and will NOT be refunded"".

I also have a statement in my rules that ""Any tip sent without a note in regards to what it is for will be considered just a tip, will NOT be applied to any services/tip menu selections, and will NOT be refunded.""

I also agree with what many have said. With him wanting you to write his name on your body, and the gist of his requests...sounds like they want it to be able to pretend you be you else where. I wouldn't do it. If you still want to do something (and see how he reacts), tell him you will consider it...but you will not be writing on your body AND all your videos MUST have your watermark on it.<|eor|><|endoftext|>",GoddessLeeLu

ultimately i don't think i'm comfortable with this so i'll turn him down, thank you for the response!

this pricing is correct but it sounds... weird? i've heard about writing things on yourself being a scam and i've never been asked to before. not only that, but it's pretty rude to demand something like that in a 24h period when i haven't even confirmed if i can do it. my wait time is longer than 24h normally anyway.

i'm just stuck because i am VERY bad at saying no. i always have been. it makes me feel really guilty?? i'm really just asking either what you would do if you got/have had a message like this or for some moral support.

Ask them not penetrate so deep. Great camera angles and positions with also help. I wouldn't worry too much. We all happen to get our periods at some point either before or during a shoot.
